On the first Wednesday of each month, at 11am PST, I _try to_ organize
a webinar. For about an hour we talk about software
development, object-oriented programming ~~and project management~~
(for project management topics listen to the [Shift-M](/shift-m.html) podcast).
Here is a full list of all webinars on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaIsQH4uc08x0H7Cu_OO72DBTNADqFXNm)

May 12, 2021<br/>
&#35;56: **Inheritance vs. Composition in Object-Oriented Programming**<br/>
Implementation Inheritance is a mechanism of code reuse, which is very popular in OOP code. However, many practitioners believe that composition is a better and cleaner alternative.

Feb 10, 2021<br/>
&#35;55: **Encapsulation Is Dead, Let's Use Distance of Coupling Instead**<br/>
Encapsulation is one of four fundamental principles in object-oriented programming. However, as we practitioners know, it doesn't really work. Getters and setters don't really help, but only make the code more complex. It is suggested to use a different approach to enforce decoupling: distance of coupling metric.

&#35;54: **How to Make a DSL with ANTLR4**<br/>
You can create your own Domain Specific Language (DSL) using ANTLR4 library in Java.
Here we discuss how this can be done and create a new DSL in less than an hour.

Dec 2, 2020<br/>
&#35;53: **Best Practices of Exception Throwing**<br/>
We discuss what are good and bad habits in exception throwing: how to create them, whether to use checked or unchecked, when to use more detailed and less detailed objects, and so on.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZWHs1mloUw"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4ZWHs1mloUw/mqdefault.jpg" class="wnr" alt="Webinar no.52 by Yegor Bugayenko"/></a>
Nov 4, 2020<br/>
&#35;52: **RAII in Java**<br/>
Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII) is a design idea introduced in C++ by Bjarne Stroustrup for exception-safe resource management. Thanks to garbage collection Java doesn't have this feature, but we can implement something similar, using try-with-resources. Let's see how exactly.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsWrgxm8ktU"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rsWrgxm8ktU/mqdefault.jpg" class="wnr" alt="Webinar no.51 by Yegor Bugayenko"/></a>
Oct 7, 2020<br/>
&#35;51: **Fat and Skinny Design**<br/>
It seems that type/class hierarchies in OOP may be designed in two extreme ways: either with full encapsulation of data in mind; or with just a few interfaces making raw data visible, and letting classes deal with it, parse it, and turn it into smaller data elements. You may be surprised, but I'm suggesting the second option is more elegant.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nErn5G_JHhE"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nErn5G_JHhE/mqdefault.jpg" class="wnr" alt="Webinar no.50 by Yegor Bugayenko"/></a>
August 5, 2020<br/>
&#35;50: **Veil Objects to Replace DTOs**<br/>
We all know that DTOs (aka value objects) are evil. But what is the alternative when we need some data to be transferred temporarily? I'm suggesting Veil Objects and this webinar demonstrates how they are used.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeXdDvIVu-Y"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eeXdDvIVu-Y/mqdefault.jpg" class="wnr" alt="Webinar no.49 by Yegor Bugayenko"/></a>
March 12, 2020<br/>
&#35;49: **What Is Cohesion in OOP?**<br/>
There are two important metrics in OOP: cohesion and coupling. The first one is the most interesting one since it can be measured. There are many ways to measure it. We discuss which of them make sense and why we should care.

December 4, 2019<br/>
&#35;48: **Why Private Static Literals are Evil?**<br/>
The most commonly used solution for the code duplication code is private static constants, which sometimes stay in the same class, but very often reside in a special Constants utility class. This approach is very wrong and only kills your design.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AfBsXOgx1s"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6AfBsXOgx1s/mqdefault.jpg" class="wnr" alt="Webinar no.47 by Yegor Bugayenko"/></a>
November 6, 2019<br/>
&#35;47: **Aspect Oriented Programming: Pros and Cons**<br/>
AOP is a very powerful technique, which is so easily can be abused. We discuss how it works, what is it for, and how to use it responsively in order to stay object-oriented.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNtTAF0UjjA"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oNtTAF0UjjA/mqdefault.jpg" class="wnr" alt="Webinar no.46 by Yegor Bugayenko"/></a>
August 7, 2019<br/>
&#35;46: **Xembly, an imperative language for XML manipulations**<br/>
Xembly is an "Assembly for XML", an imperative language for building and modifying XML documents. I'm using it in many Java projects where I need to build or modify XML pages. Here is a live demonstration of its features.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_d3AmqeGcMU"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_d3AmqeGcMU/mqdefault.jpg" class="wnr" alt="Webinar no.45 by Yegor Bugayenko"/></a>
July 3, 2019<br/>
&#35;45: **How Much Immutability Is Enough**<br/>
Immutability is a virtue in object-oriented programming, but very often it is being confused with constants. Those are different things. Immutable objects are not constants and there are a lot of possibilities to make an object immutable but still ready to accept changes.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoXV_scCMNY"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SoXV_scCMNY/mqdefault.jpg" class="wnr" alt="Webinar no.44 by Yegor Bugayenko"/></a>
June 12, 2019<br/>
&#35;44: **Logging, the Object-Oriented Way**<br/>
How do you log events from your objects? Do you use static loggers? Do
you use static methods? If you do, you are doing it wrong. There is
a better, a more object-oriented way to do that.

<!--

March 06, 2019<br/>
&#35;43: **Adding thread-safety to existing objects, in Ruby**<br/>
Thread-safety is a quality some objects in OOP may possess, but some may
not need that. It's a good practice to add thread-safety (unless you really
need something very specific and fast) via decorators. Here we demonstrate
how this can be done in Ruby.
-->

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVzEPOZ_mDU"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bVzEPOZ_mDU/mqdefault.jpg" class="wnr" alt="Webinar no.42 by Yegor Bugayenko"/></a>
February 13, 2019<br/>
&#35;42: **A practical example of making an object-oriented HTTP server in Java**<br/>
Most web frameworks hide the details of HTTP requests processing
from software developers, making it difficult to design a web application right;
in the webinar we analyze how it can be done right, in an object-oriented way.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8JMaMXydbs"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u8JMaMXydbs/mqdefault.jpg" class="wnr" alt="Webinar no.41 by Yegor Bugayenko"/></a>
January 2, 2019<br/>
&#35;41: **How many RETURN statements is enough?**<br/>
Multiple RETURN statements are considered as bad practice in object-oriented programming.
We analyze practical examples and see why exactly those statements are bad or not. The discussion is in this blog post:
[_Why Many Return Statements Are a Bad Idea in OOP_]({% pst 2015/aug/2015-08-18-multiple-return-statements-in-oop %}).

December 5, 2018<br/>
&#35;40: **The Power of Decorators**<br/>
The Decorator design pattern is a powerful tool in object-oriented programming. There is
a real practical example demonstrated, from Zold source code.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uznmzI7qsvI"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uznmzI7qsvI/mqdefault.jpg" class="wnr" alt="Webinar no.39 by Yegor Bugayenko"/></a>
November 7, 2018<br/>
&#35;39: **A practical example of ORM-free persistence layer**<br/>

October 3, 2018<br/>
&#35;38: **Parsing Objects vs Parsers**<br/>
The Parser is a very commonly used pattern in OOP, which is actually
not very object-oriented; a better alternative is parsing objects.
The discussion is based on this:
[_Don't Parse, Use Parsing Objects_]({% pst 2018/feb/2018-02-27-parsing-objects %}).

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXj9UWm1134"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oXj9UWm1134/mqdefault.jpg" class="wnr" alt="Webinar no.37 by Yegor Bugayenko"/></a>
September 12, 2018<br/>
&#35;37: **Names of objects, methods and variables in OOP**<br/>
Finding the right name for a class, a method, an object, an attribute or a variable
is a complex task in OOP. There are a few thoughts and practical examples.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNWyN_Q10TI"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FNWyN_Q10TI/mqdefault.jpg" class="wnr" alt="Webinar no.36 by Yegor Bugayenko"/></a>

July 4, 2018<br/>
&#35;35: **When do you validate your objects?**<br/>
Very often we need to validate our objects for consistency, before working with them.
A file may be absent, a database connection may get lost, a data structure may
contain invalid information, and so on. When is the right moment to validate
that, in a constructor or some time later, in a method?
[_Object Validation: to Defer or Not?_]({% pst 2018/may/2018-05-29-object-validation %})

April 4, 2018<br/>
&#35;33: **The Alternative to Fluent Interfaces in Java**<br/>
We discussed fluent interfaces design pattern by example. We
tried to create an HTTP client as an alternative to jcabi-http,
without fluent interfaces, but only with decorators and smart objects.
This blog post explains the idea:
[_Fluent Interfaces Are Bad for Maintainability_]({% pst 2018/mar/2018-03-13-fluent-interfaces %}).

January 3, 2018<br/>
&#35;31: **Decorating Envelopes**<br/>
We discussed a simple object-oriented technique I keep using in my projects and find very convenient,
it was discussed in this blog post:
[_Decorating Envelopes_]({% pst 2017/jan/2017-01-31-decorating-envelopes %})

&#35;13: **Who is Software Architect?**<br/>
Software architect is responsible for failures and is
powerful enough to make and overrule any decision. But that
is not it. We also talked about delegation of responsibility and
micromanagement. Mostly, this webinar summarized what these articles are talking about:
[_Are You a Micromanager?_]({% pst 2015/sep/2015-09-22-micromanagement %})
and
[_Who Is Software Architect?_]({% pst 2014/oct/2014-10-12-who-is-software-architect %}).

&#35;12: **Takes, Java Web Framework, Intro**<br/>
This was be a very practical Java coding webinar. We created
[jare.io](https://www.jare.io), a web system, using Takes Framework, immutable objects
and the best practices of pure fanatical object-oriented programming.
We used this blog post as a guidance:
[_Java Web App Architecture In Takes Framework_]({% pst 2015/mar/2015-03-22-takes-java-web-framework %})

We talked about famous daily meetings and why they were
actually a bad idea in a properly managed
and disciplined software project. The discussion was

&#35;10: **Why ORM is an Anti-Pattern?**<br/>
We discussed why Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) was actually
an anti-pattern and its usage must be replaced with
SQL-speaking objects. The discussion was based on
this blog post:
[_ORM Is an Offensive Anti-Pattern_]({% pst 2014/dec/2014-12-01-orm-offensive-anti-pattern %}).

&#35;9: **Dependency Injection Container is a Bad Idea**<br/>
We discussed why Dependency Injection (DI) containers were not
a good idea in object-oriented programming and what they
should be replaced with. The discussion was mostly be based
on
[_DI Containers are Code Polluters_]({% pst 2014/oct/2014-10-03-di-containers-are-evil %}).

&#35;7: **A Few Thoughts About Constructors in OOP**<br/>
We discussed the role of constructors in OOP and a few
best practices for their design, including primary vs secondary
and code-free design. The discussion was based on these articles:
[_There Can Be Only One Primary Constructor_]({% pst 2015/may/2015-05-28-one-primary-constructor %})

&#35;6: **What's Wrong About Utility Classes?**<br/>
We discussed a very common design pattern known as "Utility Class"
and its negative effects on the quality of design in object-oriented
world. The discussion was be based on this post:

&#35;5: **Don't Create Objects That End With -ER**<br/>
We talked about [class naming]({% pst 2017/feb/2017-02-28-too-many-classes %})
principles and a very typical
problem of misusing "-er" suffix for them, for example in
Managers, Observers, Controllers, Filters, Helpers, etc. The
discussion was based on this post:

&#35;4: **Why Getters-and-Setters Is An Anti-Pattern?**<br/>
We discussed why Getters-and-Setters, a very popular design
pattern in object oriented languages, is instead an anti-pattern
and must be avoided. The discussion was be based on this blog post:

&#35;3: **What's wrong about NULL in OOP?**<br/>
This webinar was about NULL references/pointers in object-oriented
programming and their negative effect on the entire design
of your application.
The webinar was mostly motivated by this post:
[_Why NULL is Bad?_]({% pst 2014/may/2014-05-13-why-null-is-bad %}).
My attitude towards NULL references is very negative, so be prepared
for an OOP "radicalism" there.

&#35;2: **Immutable Objects vs Common Sense**<br/>
The second webinar, about immutable objects and their pros and cons
in an object-oriented programming.
The webinar was based on this post:
[_Immutable Objects Are Not Dumb_]({% pst 2014/dec/2014-12-22-immutable-objects-not-dumb %}).
I made a few slides for this webinar, to illustrate my point better.
There were some interesting questions asked too.

&#35;1: **Objects vs Static Methods**<br/>
The first webinar, where we discussed the
difference between static methods and objects in object-oriented languages, like Java.
Of course, I'm in favor of objects :) The webinar is basically
motivated by this earlier post:
[_Composable Decorators vs. Imperative Utility Methods_]({% pst 2015/feb/2015-02-26-composable-decorators %}).
It took a bit longer than an hour.
