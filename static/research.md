As a junior researcher, I'm interested in two primary subjects:
automated project management and object-oriented programming.
You can find me in
[Scopus](https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=30367443600),
[Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.ru/citations?user=cYmXh60AAAAJ)
and [DBLP](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/hd/b/Bugayenko:Yegor) too.
I'm also a co-organizer of [ICCQ](https://www.iccq.ru/).

If you are a student and looking for a research topic for your diploma, or
just want to do an interesting R&D project, pick one of the research question
from one of the lists below, and then text me [in Telegram](https://t.me/yegor256),
we will discuss:

  * [OSBP](https://gist.github.com/yegor256/7907d47b44ca6e048430bb0fcccf8fd0)
  * [PainOfOOP](https://gist.github.com/yegor256/9c7ac9fbd45469a08eb68cfe09d451c3)
  * [SQM](https://gist.github.com/yegor256/3dde3560d26ba1d7b1d2a91dbe118a12)
  * [PMBA](https://gist.github.com/yegor256/3d04cb381d3df26aa99e965e20cf11ef)

A few more topics you can find in the [objectionary/ideas](https://github.com/objectionary/ideas) repository,
they are all related to [EOLANG](https://www.eolang.org).

You may also pick one of our open source projects, and extend it with
a new feature, presenting this work as engineering+science:

  * [eo](https://github.com/objectionary/eo) (Java)
  * [cam](https://github.com/yegor256/cam) (Bash, Python)
  * [rultor](https://github.com/yegor256/rultor) (Java, Docker, AWS, XSL)
  * [qulice](https://github.com/yegor256/qulice) (Java, AST, XML)
  * [takes](https://github.com/yegor256/takes) (Java, HTTP)
  * [cactoos](https://github.com/yegor256/cactoos) (Java)
  * [jpeek](https://github.com/yegor256/jpeek) (Java, XSL)
  * [zold](https://github.com/zold-io/zold) (Ruby)
  * [micromap](https://github.com/yegor256/micromap) (Rust)

In each of them, there are over a hundred unresolved issues and pull requests.
I can help you figure our how to formulate your coding contribution
such that it would look like a diploma work.
