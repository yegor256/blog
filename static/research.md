Aside from being a programmer, I'm also a part-time researcher.
You can find me in [Scopus], [Google Scholar], and [DBLP] too.
I'm also a chair of organization committee of the [ICCQ] conference.
I'm interested in answering two research questions:

* Can robots manage humans?
* Can object-oriented code be faster than procedural?

As you can imagine, the questions are challenging, especially for a solo researcher.
I need your help.
If you are a student, a practicionaire, a professor, or a team of them---we can do a study together.
I'm not looking for a free help, though, and prepared to reward you.

This is how it works:
First, you pick up one of the research questions listed below.
Then, you reach out to me to get an approval to start the research ([text me][tg]).
Then, we together do the study, write a paper, and try publish it on an A*-conference, as co-authors.
When the paper is accepted by a conference, I pay you **$4,096** (per paper, not per author).
Let's call it a **stipend**.

An important thing to note before you start: we must strictly follow the [Research Flow]({% pst 2024/feb/2024-02-06-research-flow %}) guidelines.
If we fall off the schedule, I may stop contributing to the study.
I simply can't afford spending time on every single project, especially if the discipline is compromised.
However, even if I stop contributing, you may still publish the study, but without my name on it.
In this case you will get only **$1,024**.

These are the research questions, in no particular order:
