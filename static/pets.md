It's a full list of my pet projects (which are still alive). If interested
in helping any of them, don't hesitate to [email](mailto:pets@yegor256.com).
Also, there are a number of projects, which I haven't fully started yet,
because I don't have enough time. If you're a Java or Ruby programmer, I'd be
interested to discuss a co-founding opportunity for you: I will pay for
all project expenses and you will write software. We will be co-founders.
[Email me](mailto:cofounder@yegor256.com).

[Qulice](https://www.qulice.com) is an aggregate of a few popular and powerful
style checkers for Java, in particular Checkstyle and PMD. Qulice not only makes it
easy to use them all in one package, but also extends them with a few dozen
rules, which are pretty strong and rather controversial. I use Qulice in all
Java projects of mine.
