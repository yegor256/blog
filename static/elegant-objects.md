"Elegant Objects" is my first book. It is about object-oriented
programming from an idealistic and, maybe, a bit of a futuristic
point of view. There are 23 independent recommendations for
a practical OOP designer on how to make code cleaner, classes
more solid, and architecture more visible. It is available for sale
on [Amazon](http://goo.gl/W2WVMk) (Please don't forget to review it there!),
ISBN: 1519166915. The changelog is [here](https://github.com/yegor256/elegantobjects).

Mar 7, 2017:
I've started to write the third volume, which will consist entirely
of "OOP puzzles." Just like in math or chess books, there will be questions
that you will have to think about and answers at the end of the book.
Want to become a reviewer? Please fill out
[this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1d1DgAj8wYOXqmg8wMw_PpPXSEWKZMIa5Y5oEmCN8I7o).

The list of reviewers for the second volume is ready (alphabetic order). I'm very
sorry if you're not on the list but wanted to be. There will be
[more books](/books.html) in the future, so you will still have a chance. Aside from that, you are always
welcome to read the book and send me your
corrections; they will get
you on the "acknowledgment" list. See how others have
[done that](https://github.com/yegor256/elegantobjects). Here you are:

на русском языке, а английский оригинальный текст, дополненный
вступлениями на русском. Объем книги 330 страниц (оригинальный
английский вариант содержит только 229 страниц). Также, это издание
начинается с ревью, сделанного пятью участниками подкаста (в
порядке получения ревью):
[Барух Садогурский](https://twitter.com/jbaruch),
[Антон Архипов](https://twitter.com/antonarhipov),

Повторного тиража на русском языке не будет! Тексты ревью всех пяти
участников подкаста я выложу онлайн сразу после продажи последнего
экземпляра этого тиража. Цена: $40. Для участников конференций, где
я выступаю: $20 (бывают [еще скидки](/books.html)).

Feb 7, 2017:
This is the full list of everybody who expressed
a desire to become a reviewer of the **2nd volume** of
"Elegant Objects." I have to select up to 12 people, so please help me with your
vote. What does it mean to be a reviewer? It's easy:

  * I will mail you the draft of the book (a paper copy, not PDF);
  * You criticize it as much as you can;
  * You scan it and send it back to me as a PDF;
  * I'll take your suggestions and corrections into account;
  * Your name will be included in the list of acknowledgments in the book; and
  * You'll get a free signed copy of the book.

Pay attention: I need your negative comments, not your positive ones. I don't
really need you to say how much you like the content&mdash;that's pointless.
I need you to tell me where it's missing something, or unclear, or wrong.
People on the list are sorted by the date I received their applications.
I excluded some really blank applications. If you feel I did that by mistake
to your application, please [email me](mailto:blog@yegor256.com).

Good news: The second volume is ready (208 pages). Now it's time to select
the team of reviewers, ship the draft to them, collect their opinions,
and publish the book. Hopefully, it will be available on Amazon before
March 10. Here is my offer to all new readers of this new book: If you write
a decent review about the book (not necessarily positive,
but long enough for a detailed review) and post it on your blog, Amazon, and
GoodReads, I will refund your **$32** (read more about [available discounts](/books.html)).

Nov 20, 2016:
I've received more than 50 emails from those who are interested in reviewing
the second volume of the book. With the first volume, I believe, I made
a mistake in selecting reviewers. Not all of them were as effective as
I was expecting. This time, I will make the process different. I will put all
of them on a list and let you vote. The best 12, elected by you,
will get the early draft of the second volume and help me review it. To
get onto the list, please fill out <del>this simple form</del>.

[Object-Oriented Design](http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/4013/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_b_1_5_last) category!
There are [three reviews](http://goo.gl/W2WVMk)
already. Many thanks to their authors! It would
be great if you published yours&mdash;this will greatly help
in promoting the manuscript. Besides that, I will be presenting the
book at the following conferences over the next few months:
[JPoint](http://javapoint.ru/en/) in Moscow, April 22;
JETConf in Minsk, April 25;
[GeeCON](http://2016.geecon.org/) in Krakow, May 11;
[DEVit](http://devitconf.org/) in Thessaloniki, May 20; and
[JEEConf](http://jeeconf.com/speaker/yegor-bugayenko/) in Kiev, May 21.
I will give away a few copies at each event to those who
ask the most interesting questions after my presentations. Don't miss your
chance to say hello and get a free book.

More than 100 books have sold already, in just one week! I'm glad to see
that you're interested in reading it. I haven't got a single review yet,
but I'm sure there will be some. I would like to ask you to post your
reviews, either negative or positive, directly to
[Amazon](http://goo.gl/W2WVMk).
I'm getting many requests for an **electronic version** of the book, but
I'm not planning to turn this into an e-book at least until the end
of 2018. That's mostly [because]({% pst 2016/nov/2016-11-09-why-no-ebooks %})
I'm greedy. I realize that the moment I publish
a Kindle version, it will be available for a free download somewhere.
However, some of you have said that the "dead tree" format is not
convenient, because it takes up too much space, etc., so here is my offer:
You buy a paper book now, read it, take a picture of it,
and throw it away so it doesn't take up space. When an e-book is available,
send me that picture and I will send you a Kindle/epub/PDF/whatever
file **for free**. How does that sound?

The book is published! It is for sale
[on Amazon](http://goo.gl/W2WVMk).
The price is $40.96. The size is 229 pages. The paper is creamy.
The cover is mate. I took into account the recommendations and corrections
of nine reviewers. Two of them were missed due to technical reasons. I will
definitely include them in the next edition. If you decide to buy it,
please leave your feedback
[on Amazon](http://goo.gl/W2WVMk).
It will help me attract more readers. After reading, please shoot me
an email at [book@yegor256.com](mailto:book@yegor256.com).
I'm very interested in knowing what you think. Thanks!

This cute cactus, created by [Andreea Mironiuc](http://andreeamironiuc.com/),
will be on the cover of the book. For a number of reasons. First,
because it's elegant. Isn't it? Second, it's alive, just like
all our objects in Java. Right? Third, it's pretty hard to offend by
breaking its skin and treating it as a bag for other objects. And fourth,
I just like it.

last two to send me their results, and then I will start making
final changes. Fortunately, the overall feedback is **positive**
so far. All reviewers said the book was worth reading.

Here is a small Christmas gift for those who are interested
in the book: [**seven pages** from chapter 2.4](/images/books/elegant-objects/seven-pages.pdf), which
covers a subject I haven't discussed on the blog yet.
This is not exactly the text you will see in the book, though. This is the
text my selected **11 reviewers** received this week from me by mail.
By the way, their names are (in alphabetic order):
[Andrei Istomin](http://www.linkedin.com/in/andrej-istomin-51ba7530),
[Aneesh Dogra](http://in.linkedin.com/in/aneeshdogra),

[Thanasis Papapanagiotou](http://nl.linkedin.com/in/thanpa),
and [Xiasong Pan](http://www.linkedin.com/in/xipan).
I hope to receive their reviews by the end of January. Then, I will
spend another two to three weeks taking their recommendations into account,
and the book will go out at the end of February.

<div class="book-event"/>
Dec 6, 2015:
I've received **63 emails** so far, and it's time to choose the best candidates.
I will do that in the next few days and email them. I will announce
the names of selected reviewers here soon. Thanks a lot to all of you
for your readiness to help!

Nov 22, 2015:
The book is ready in its first draft, version **0.1**.
I invite you to become its first reviewer. Send me
an [email](mailto:book@yegor256.com) with a short description about yourself.
I will select a few reviewers (eight is the number I have in mind now).
Then, I will send you a book. It's free, and I will
pay for shipping. You will read it (200 pages), and make your corrections
right inside the book. Then, ship it back to me using
UPS [collect on delivery](https://www.ups.com/content/us/en/shipping/time/service/value_added/cod.html).
Your name will be in the book, on the ninth page,
in the list of **acknowledgments**!
I'm interested in your negative feedback mostly.
Tell me what is not clear, what is missing, and what needs a more detailed
explanation. But please **don't argue** with my ideas. I won't change
them based on your review. For example, if I'm saying that a
static method is a bad thing and you disagree, don't try to
convince me, as it won't help :) This is my opinion, and this is what the
book is about. However, I'm sure that my **explanations** and **arguments**
have many flaws. As an early reviewer, you will help me find them.
Again, don't argue with **what** I'm preaching, but complain about **how** I do it.

<div class="book-event"/>
Sep 1, 2015:
The manuscript is finished, in its first draft. It took about 200 hours. Most
of the ideas were taken from the articles previously published on the blog.
