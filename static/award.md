{% badge /images/andreea/quality-award.svg 300 %}

I'm a big fan of rules and discipline in software development; as an example, see
[Are You a Hacker or a Designer?]({% pst 2014/oct/2014-10-26-hacker-vs-programmer-mentality %}).
Also, I'm a big fan of object-oriented programming in its purest form; for example, see
[Seven Virtues of a Good Object]({% pst 2014/nov/2014-11-20-seven-virtues-of-good-object %}).
I'm also a co-founder and a retired CEO of [Zerocracy](https://www.zerocracy.com), a software development
company through which I put my admiration of discipline and clean design into practice.

I want to encourage you to share my passion&mdash;not just by reading this blog
but through making real
[open source software]({% pst 2015/dec/2015-12-22-why-dont-you-contribute-to-open-source %}) in a disciplined way.
This award is for those who are brave enough to swim against the current and
value quality above everything else.

Since 2023, the award is renamed to [Kaicode Open Source Festival](https://www.kaicode.org).
