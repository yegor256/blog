"Elegant Objects" is a book series about object-oriented
programming. There are two volumes at the moment, they are
available for purchase on [Amazon](http://goo.gl/W2WVMk). This page
contains some of the reviews readers were ever sending me. I try to put the most
interesting ones here, from all possible sources, including Amazon,
GoodReads, email, chats, etc. There is no particular order in this list.

[David West](http://davewest.us/),
Author of [Object Thinking](https://amzn.to/2ass77O):<br/>
"Yegor Bugayenko's books, Elegant Objects I & II, show you how to
correctly and elegantly implement the object concept in code; while all
other books show you how to use code to warp and corrupt the object concept."

[Anton Arhipov](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1724551901),
Java Champion, Developer Advocate at [ZeroTurnaround](https://zeroturnaround.com/):<br/>
"Probably the most practical book about OOP I've read so far."

[Ben Nadel](https://www.bennadel.com/blog/3108-elegant-objects-by-yegor-bugayenko.htm),
Co-founder at [InVision](https://www.invisionapp.com/):<br/>
"I definitely enjoyed this book and will be re-reading it again soon."

[Baruch Sadogursky](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1EAWT563455BU/),
Developer Advocate of [JFrog](https://www.jfrog.com/):<br/>
"It's facinating."

[Eduards Sizovs](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1716906360),
Co-founder of [DevTernity](http://devternity.com/):<br/>
"Well-written, entertaining, practical, bold and marginal at times."

[Anton Chernousov](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1PLMTYQ0BP6XM/),
Founder of [The Art of Programming](https://theartofprogramming.podbean.com/):<br/>
"It is one of the best books if you have a lot of experience in different projects."
