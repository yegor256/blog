If you already purchased and read my books, please review them on
[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Yegor-Bugayenko/e/B01AM1QMDK) and/or
[GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/author/list/15033289.Yegor_Bugayenko).
Those reviews really make a difference and new readers are paying attention to them. You will
help me a lot if you post them. Please, make them honest and as detailed
as you can.

There are **no digital books** published, only paper versions, here is
[why]({% pst 2016/nov/2016-11-09-why-no-ebooks %}). However, if you really
want to have a PDF version and you have a good reason for it (for example,
you are blind), you may email me a proof of purchase of the book, and I will
send you the PDF version (rendered with your name inside, to make sure
you don't share it with others).

{% badge /images/books/elegant-objects/cover-eo1.png 125 /elegant-objects.html %}

[Elegant Objects](/elegant-objects.html) (two volumes)
is my first book. It is about object-oriented
programming, from an idealistic and, maybe, a bit futuristic
point of view. There are 23 independent recommendations for
a practical OOP designer on how to make code cleaner, classes
more solid and architecture more visible.

{% badge /images/books/256-bloghacks/cover.png 125 /256-bloghacks.html %}

[256 Bloghacks](/256-bloghacks.html) is a book about blogging,
disclosing all techniques, secrets and tactics I'm using at this blog.
It contains many small and big recommendations,
which I would be glad to hear when I started blogging. Unfortunately,
I didn't have that book back then. You have a chance to learn everything
in just one go.

[Code Ahead](/code-ahead.html) is a novel about software engineering. In this book I
propose a number of best practices for organizing software development
process. What is interesting is that it is a semi-biographical fiction book, with
characters, plot, jokes, dialogs, etc.

{% badge /images/books/junior-objects/cover.png 125 /junior-objects.html %}

It is a book for junior programmers or even for someone who hasn't
seen a computer yet. It starts from the explanation of basic things
and gets into details about object-oriented programming, getting you
ready to become a professional developer, eventually. You may consider
it a prequel to Elegant Objects.

{% badge /images/books/angry-tests/cover-1.png 125 /angry-tests.html %}

It is a book about automated testing. It summarizes everything I have to say about unit testing,
integration testing, and code quality. It is essentially a summary of my
practical experience from the last few decades of programming and writing
tests. The book may be interesting to hands-on programmers---it can help you
make your tests more helpful---regardless of your programming language.

## How to Get a Discount

All books have the same price of $40.96 (plus shipment from Amazon).
You have a few options if you want to get them cheaper than that:

  * Attend a conference where I'm speaking. In most cases I have a few
    books with me. If I don't, you just [email me](mailto:shop@yegor256.com) later and attach
    a photo of your conference badge. The price in that case will be **$20.00** plus
    shipment, which in most cases is $7.00. This discount is effective
    only during 14 days after the conference.

  * You can buy a book for its full price on Amazon and then
    write a blog post _and_ an Amazon review (both honest, not
    necessarily positive). I will send you back $32.00 (via PayPal or check).
    Thus, the final cost of the book will be somewhere around **$12.00**.

  * If you're a student, find seven other friends and you will
    get a **student package** of 8 books for $64.00 plus shipment.
    Thus, you will get each book for **$8.00**. I will need you to confirm
    that all of you guys really are students though.
