I started to write books in July 2016 and have big plans to publish at least
one book a year. I'm going to write about object-oriented programming
([Elegant Objects](/elegant-objects.html) series), project management,
philosophy of software engineering ([Code Ahead](/code-ahead.html) series),
blogging, lifestyle, and philosophy.

If you already purchased and read my books, please review them on
[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Yegor-Bugayenko/e/B01AM1QMDK) and/or
[GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/author/list/15033289.Yegor_Bugayenko).
Those reviews really make a difference and new readers are paying attention to them. You will
help me a lot if you post them. Please, make them honest and as detailed
as you can.

There are **no digital books** published, only paper versions, here is
[why]({% pst 2016/nov/2016-11-09-why-no-ebooks %}). However, if you really
want to have a PDF version and you have a good reason for it (for example,
you are blind), you may email me a proof of purchase of the book, and I will
send you the PDF version (rendered with your name inside, to make sure
you don't share it with others).

[Elegant Objects](/elegant-objects.html) (Volume 1)
is my first book. It is about object-oriented
programming, from an idealistic and, maybe, a bit futuristic
point of view. There are 23 independent recommendations for
a practical OOP designer on how to make code cleaner, classes
more solid and architecture more visible.

[256 Bloghacks](/256-bloghacks.html) is a book about blogging,
disclosing all techniques, secrets and tactics I'm using at this blog.
It contains many small and big recommendations,
which I would be glad to hear when I started blogging. Unfortunately,
I didn't have that book back then. You have a chance to learn everything
in just one go.

The **2nd Volume** of [Elegant Objects](/elegant-objects.html)
covers more object-oriented patterns and anti-patterns,
including MVC, ORM, annotations, printers, validators, inheritance and subtyping,
dependency injection, reflection, and others.

[Code Ahead](/code-ahead.html) is a novel about software engineering. In this book I
propose a number of best practices for organizing software development
process. What is interesting is that it is a semi-biographical fiction book, with
characters, plot, jokes, dialogs, etc.

{% badge /images/books/junior-objects/cover.png 125 /junior-objects.html %}

It is a book for junior programmers or even for someone who hasn't
seen a computer yet. It starts from the explanation of basic things
and gets into details about object-oriented programming, getting you
ready to become a professional developer, eventually. You may consider
it a prequel to Elegant Objects.

The **3rd Volume** of [Elegant Objects](/elegant-objects.html)
will contain practical object-oriented design patterns, just like
those GoF book suggested. The book will not criticize bad practices, like
previous two volumes did, but will suggest what to do instead.

To be published: in 2022.

## How to Get a Discount

All books have the same price of $40.96 (plus shipment from Amazon).
You have a few options if you want to get them cheaper than that:

  * Attend a conference where I'm speaking. In most cases I have a few
    books with me. If I don't, you just [email me](mailto:shop@yegor256.com) later and attach
    a photo of your conference badge. The price in that case will be **$20.00** plus
    shipment, which in most cases is $7.00. This discount is effective
    only during 14 days after the conference.

  * You can buy a book for its full price on Amazon and then
    write a blog post _and_ an Amazon review (both honest, not
    necessarily positive). I will send you back $32.00 (via PayPal or check).
    Thus, the final cost of the book will be somewhere around **$12.00**.

  * If you're a student, find seven other friends and you will
    get a **student package** of 8 books for $64.00 plus shipment.
    Thus, you will get each book for **$8.00**. I will need you to confirm
    that all of you guys really are students though.

Pay attention that all books are sold at
