I announced an invitation to help me review the book. If you are
interested in volunteering, fill out
[this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/17chSctRwT4TFaVsQjC-66sl0pAx5i3_Xnwfhq-q-psQ).
I will select 16 best candidates, they will get a manuscript, their
corrections will be taken into account, their names will be in the
Acknowledgments page of the book, and each of them will get a free hard copy
of the book, by mail, for free, with my autograph.
