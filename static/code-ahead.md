"Code Ahead" will be my <del>second</del> fourth book. It will be about software engineering. It
will contain a number of best practices, which help software live longer.
All of that principles I've learned from my practical experience. It will
be published in <del>November 2017</del> February 2018.

Mar 29, 2018:
After a few rather critical reviews I re-wrote and re-structured the book
a lot. It lost one section and became more focused. It's less of a fiction
now and more technical. The text is fully ready. Now I will send it for
a proof-reading and then will publish. Before the end of April it will
be available on Amazon.

Jan 1, 2018:
The book is almost finished,
here is the [contents](/images/books/code-ahead/contents.pdf) of the book.
There will be about 220 pages. I will select 10 reviewers in the next two
weeks.

I purchased the domain [codeahead.org](http://www.codeahead.org).

Mar 7, 2017:
I wrote a two-page intro to the book. It will be a **novel**. A novel about
programmers, testers, managers, executives, clients, and computers. The
main character will try to fight his way through a very typical
corporate culture. I've never done fiction writing before. Let's see
how will it work out.

I've got over 30 emails from those who are interested in **reviewing**
this book. To make the process transparent let's make it simple. I will put
applicants in a list and let you vote. The best 12, elected by you,
will get the early draft of the book and will help me review it. To
get into the list, please fill
[this simple form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1nW8lD1YsW4x78iy2LreZ-FVoyoD5s5_MydVH9LGJImA).

Aug 15, 2016:
I finally found the right name for this book: "Code Ahead." It is derived
from "think ahead," with a focus on code and coders. The book will
explain what I think has to be done in any software project to make
the lifetime of the software longer.
