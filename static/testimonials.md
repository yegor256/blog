"Self-opinionated intellectually-correct only-code-focusing high-ego moron"&mdash;[José](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/10/03/di-containers-are-evil.html#comment-3212271221)

"You're a self opinionated asshole and I hope you suffocate
under the weight of your giant ego, you clueless asshole."&mdash;anonymous (by email)

"Yegor you are a professional name-dropper, a talker, not a doer,
so please stop pretending your own dumb mantras, certs, "methodologies" like
"puzzle-driven-development" (seriously?) mean jack-shit because you SUCK
and are constipated with your own opinions. You are the epitome of
what Dijkstra (a doer, unlike you) said was wrong with software development
so go fuck yourself. I understand that you have to promote your business
but goddamn you would probably choke any programmer who worked under
you by dictating what angle they held a bloody pencil at you dip. Please stop"&mdash;anonymous (by email)

"You are great at writing code that is painful to understand, use and explain."&mdash;[Ross W.](https://www.yegor256.com/2015/12/08/temporal-coupling-between-method-calls.html#comment-2401444164)

"The author is the type of person that embodies everything that's
wrong with this industry: hypocritical, holds people to
a standard he doesn't meet, lacks basic empathy and
the ability to put himself in another person's shoes&mdash;some kind
of coward/sociopath hybrid. Would be laughable if it wasn't pathetic."&mdash;[NoOne](https://www.yegor256.com/2015/12/22/why-dont-you-contribute-to-open-source.html#comment-3099486424)

bedroom and play with your dick."&mdash;[Martin L.](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/12/01/orm-offensive-anti-pattern.html#comment-2601044224)

"Your blog makes me think of how to structure a society so
that people who share your philosophy of management
would never get the chance to foist it on the people who don't."&mdash;[Boris D.](https://www.yegor256.com/2019/07/10/inversive-management.html#comment-4691783834)

"If I would be the one to decide what is irresponsible coding
you would be imprisoned for a lifetime by me."&mdash;[David R.](https://www.yegor256.com/2015/11/24/imprisonment-for-irresponsible-coding.html#comment-2376244941)

"Do not waste your money on the book; It will teach you nothing&mdash;or worse,
it may teach you to hold on to absurd, opinionated, borderline superstitious
programming habits."&mdash;[Mario V.](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/customer-reviews/R6OIRSV3GP402/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewpnt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1519166915#R6OIRSV3GP402)

"You're promoting waterfall, cutting corners, illegible code, dysfunctional social team dynamics,
bad design principles and basically ignoring reality and anything
our industry has achieved in the last decade."&mdash;[Lieven D.](https://twitter.com/lievendoclo/status/986257188803969025)

"I bought your first book and read it for 10 mins.
Then realized it was a copy paste from your website and
threw it to the trash can. I regret it tho, because I now own a dog and sometimes

"If it's a conference talk then people just leave the room, if it's a project
then it's a just messy bunch of libraries that he puts together in the dirtiest way,
and if it's a podcast interview he can't provide a good technical explanation
of his point of view..."&mdash;[@heldev](https://github.com/heldev)
