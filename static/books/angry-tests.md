"Angry Tests" is a book about automated testing. I wrote it in just one month:
January 2025. It summarizes everything I have to say about unit testing,
integration testing, and code quality. It is essentially a summary of my
practical experience from the last few decades of programming and writing
tests. The book may be interesting to hands-on programmers---it can help you
make your tests more helpful---regardless of your programming language.
