Nov 19, 2018:
I signed a contract with Piter, a Russian publishing house. They will
translate the book to Russian and publish in Russia.

Jul 6, 2018:
It is finally published, in version 1.0.

Jun 15, 2018:
The manuscript is finally ready.
[Phew!](https://twitter.com/yegor256/status/1007494042345721856)
It took way more time and energy than I expected.
Now the proof-reading phase and it's out.

Mar 29, 2018:
After a few rather critical reviews I re-wrote and re-structured the book
a lot. It lost one section and became more focused. It's less of a fiction
now and more technical. The text is fully ready. Now I will send it for
a proof-reading and then will publish. Before the end of April it will
be available on Amazon.

Jan 1, 2018:
The book is almost finished,
here is the [contents](/images/books/code-ahead/contents.pdf) of the book.
There will be about 220 pages. I will select 10 reviewers in the next two
weeks.

Dec 27, 2017:
I purchased the domain [codeahead.org](https://www.codeahead.org).

Mar 7, 2017:
I wrote a two-page intro to the book. It will be a **novel**. A novel about
programmers, testers, managers, executives, clients, and computers. The
main character will try to fight his way through a very typical
corporate culture. I've never done fiction writing before. Let's see
how will it work out.

Nov 20, 2016:
I've got over 30 emails from those who are interested in **reviewing**
this book. To make the process transparent let's make it simple. I will put
applicants in a list and let you vote. The best 12, elected by you,
will get the early draft of the book and will help me review it.

Aug 15, 2016:
I finally found the right name for this book: "Code Ahead." It is derived
from "think ahead," with a focus on code and coders. The book will
explain what I think has to be done in any software project to make
the lifetime of the software longer.
