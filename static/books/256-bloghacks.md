"256 Bloghacks" is a book about blogging. It says everything
I can say about my blogging experience here, at this blog. I put
all my numbers there, all stats and all secrets. It is a collection
of hints, hacks, ideas, and recommendations. Hopefully it will help
young bloggers to achieve some success, at least initially. My blog
is not really big, but it gets 60,000 unique monthly visitors now
and keeps growing. You will definitely learn something new from this
book.
Buy it on [Amazon](https://goo.gl/DUcXm9) (please, don't forget to review it there!),

what this is for, but it makes my pages look nicer in Google search result
page.

I will post here all technical and content changes I'm making to the blog,
in order to include them later into the second edition of the book. I will describe
them here just briefly, without any analysis. You may take a look at this
page time to time, to get fresh ideas for your blog too. A few days ago
I added [`og:image`](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/sharing/webmasters)
meta to all blog posts and
[`longdesc`](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-longdesc/) to all front images.
Also [added](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yegor256/blog/1/static/contents.md)
total Disqus comments counter to the full list of blog posts.

It's finished. There are 181 pages, 38K words, and I still feel like I
forgot to say something important. I'm interested in your feedback. Please,
email me to [book@yegor256.com](mailto:book@yegor256.com) if you are
interested in becoming the first reader and helping me review it. I will
send you the entire book in PDF, you will make your comments and questions
and email them back to me. I'm mostly interested to know what else you
would want me to say there&mdash;what did I forget.

I started to write it.
