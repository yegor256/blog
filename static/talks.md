This is a very opinionated and subjective list of conferences
that I attended recently as a speaker. They rate us as speakers,
so why shouldn't we rate them, right? The best grade is
<span class="green">**A+**</span>, while the worst is
<span class="red">**F-**</span>.

How Much Do You Cost?
[DevTernity 2017](https://devternity.com/);

It was my second year with these guys and I liked it more than in 2016.
The travel, the food, the equipment, the venue were very good. What they still
are missing, I believe, is the interaction between speakers and the audience
outside of the presentation rooms. They need to work harder, I believe, to
connect me with my listeners before the show and after it. Also, to connect
me with other speakers. Aside from that, they are definitely growing, I will
try to attend next year.

The event was organized by JUG.ru guys (authors of JPoint and Joker) and
it was rather good, as usual. Maybe because it was not Java community, I didn't
get as much value from the event as I was getting from JPoint, but the
overall impression was good. The accomodation, the venue, the equipment,
the food were perfect. What I missed was the promotional part and the social
activity around the talks.

St.Peterburg, Russia;
5-7 July 2017;
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVmRY4Ri4CA).
The conference was well organized, but rather small for five tracks. There
were no more than 30 people at my talk. The venue was far away from the
city center which made it difficult to see the historic center of
Saint Peterburg. The equipment was not of a high quality. The food was great,
the audience was well prepared, the organizers friendly.

[slides](https://www.slideshare.net/YegorBugayenko/java-annotations-are-a-bad-idea).
The food, the accomodation, the audience, the equipment was good. The location
was rather far away from the hotel. Aside from that, the conference was
surprisingly good, even though I was told that in 2016 there were not enough
attendees. This year there were just two tracks, about 80 people at my talk.
Will be glad to visit again.

The event was much smaller than it was announced. I hardly had 40 people
in the room, even though my talk was one of the first. The venue was
average, the organization was good, the food was tasty.

There were some technical problems in my talk (you can see them in the video),
but aside from that the event was interesting and well-organized. The team
definitely did it with passion and invested a lot of effort in it. Maybe
a better warming up social procedures would be helpful next year. Would be
glad to attend again, if they invite.

This was my second year and it did work even better than in 2016. The location
was better, the accomodation was perfect, the team was very dedicated, the
audience was interested. Will definitely try to attend next year.

[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCr8hRE_TUs),
[slides](https://www.slideshare.net/YegorBugayenko/objectoriented-flavor-for-junit-tests).
As usual, this conference was very good, but this year something was missing.
The venue was perfect, the accomodation, the team, the audience, the
equipment at the highest level. I guess the content could be better with
the budget these guys have available. More cutting-edge talks, more panel
discussions, more provocation, more scandals. It was rather quiet and routine.
Will try to attend next year.

[slides](https://www.slideshare.net/YegorBugayenko/how-to-avoid-outsourcing-disaster).
The event was smaller than I expected, the location was of a rather
low quality, and the audience was pretty much random. Maybe that's because
of the subject, or the time of the year.

[GeeCON 2017](https://geecon.org/);
Kraków, Poland;
18-19 May 2017;
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSh_Gpnn6fo).
The event was very big, but many things were not as good as I would expect.
It was in the cinema, as in 2016&mdash;not the best location, if you ask me.
The food was average, the accomodation too. The key issue was the lack
of social connection between speakers and attendees.

[slides](https://www.slideshare.net/YegorBugayenko/how-bright-is-our-future).
The event was rather good, even though the location was not great (the cinema),
the food was average and the equipment was not perfect. There were enough
people for my talks, they were interested and I've got many interesting
responses.

Java Annotations Are a Big Mistake;
JPoint 2017;
Moscow, Russia;
8 April 2017;
[видео](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20QBvrHq6TA) (with English subtitles),
[slides](https://www.slideshare.net/YegorBugayenko/java-annotations-are-evil).
JPoint is one of the best tech conferences I've spoken at so far. Its
strong points are the social activities between speakers, the community,
equipment, location, accommodation, and help with travel. Its weak points
still are the content and its focus on the Russian-speaking community. It would be
great if they could make their events more international and less "Russian-only."
Aside from that, this is definitely an event I would try to attend again.

[slides](https://www.slideshare.net/YegorBugayenko/utility-classes-are-killing-us).
Yet another great event by [JUG.ru](https://jug.ru/) in Siberia. This was
my first time there, and I enjoyed almost everything: the location, the
organization, travel planning, equipment, and audience. The only thing I didn't
like was the quality of food. Aside from that, I would say that JBreak is an
even better event than JPoint. Maybe because I like smaller one-day events more than
bigger ones that take a few days.

A Few Best Practices for Time-Wasting on a Software Team;

Delft, The Netherlands;
30 March 2017;
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSBf2RftCKo).
Surprisingly, the event was rather good, even though it was commercial
and put on by a private company (usually such events suck). This one was well-
organized with interesting speakers, good equipment, and a lot of passion
from the team. I received a lot of negative comments from the audience about
my subject, but that's how it has to be with the problem I'm discussing. I'll
definitely recommend it next year.

The event was rather big, and the audience rather active, but I didn't really
feel like I was "there." In the two days I was there, I didn't even meet anybody
from the team that organized it. I was by myself, sitting in the lobby, waiting
for my slot&mdash;this is not what motivates a speaker. Aside from that,
everything was decent: the food, the equipment, the location, the travel, etc.
I believe it's important to be there, because the event is rather big.

Yet another event by [LemBS](http://lembs.com/), this time in Kharkiv.
The organization was rather good: the travel and accommodation, the food, the
equipment. What was not really good was the content&mdash;they can do much
better in such a big city with many outsourcing companies. Also, the promotion
part was not as strong as it should be&mdash;most people in the room had never
heard anything about me, etc.

The size of the event was perfect, the audience was motivated, and the
organizers were actively involved, so I liked it. What I didn't like
was the food and the lack of "social glue" between presenters, attendees, and
everybody involved. I'm sure next year they will do it better.

It was probably too big to be managed right. The Lithuanian part was a bit
better, while the Ukrainian was not so great at all, maybe because I don't like
that Olympiski sport center. Also, in Vilnius there were maybe 15 people
at my presentation&mdash;that was just sad. What I did like was the food.

This event was organized by the same people who did JEEConf. This time it was
smaller, at a different place, and with less attention to detail, if you ask me.
However, my overall impression was very good; the organizers definitely know what
they are doing. I will try to attend again next year.

The event was <del>pretty</del> too big; I would say about 800 attendees, 60 speakers, six tracks, and three
full days plus workshops. For that size of a conference, organizers need
to do way more "social" work for speakers and everybody else. I made almost
no connections there, and most people I met had the same problem. It's a typical
issue for big conferences&mdash;you simply get lost. At this one, they had every
chance to make a great event, but... Aside from that, the venue was great,
the food was good, and the travel and accommodation were perfect. I will definitely try
to attend next year.

The venue was great, the size average (about 500 people), and organizers were
very friendly and motivated. I liked the event. A few things definitely
need to be improved, though: the food and the number of tracks. There were too many tracks,
I guess, for the number of people who attended. It would be better to invite fewer
speakers and focus the audience on the best of them. And spend
the money they saved on better food.

There were about 250 people with just one track and a pretty good
organization, even though the budget was rather low. I liked the event and
the audience. However, the venue was not comfortable at all
(It was literally a church).

It was a surprisingly well-organized one-day event with more than 300 attendees,
two tracks, and an inexpensive entry ticket ($75). Even though the budget
was rather low, they paid for travel and hotel, and invited speakers mostly
from abroad. The audience was well-prepared for my talk, and I got many questions
right after the presentation and throughout the rest of the day. However, the
venue was not really comfortable, and the content was mostly outdated.

Almost everything was done perfectly at this event. There were more than 500 attendees
and just two tracks (when I was speaking). The venue was very comfortable,
modern, and located within walking distance from the center. All the logistics
were done perfectly, the food was of high quality, the team was personally
there and in permanent contact with speakers. It's absolutely a must to be there
again.

It was a very big event with, I'd guess, 1,500 visitors and nine (!) tracks.
What was good was they paid for all travel expenses, and the venue was
really modern. Aside from that, everything else was not so good. There was
no focus on content, the audience wasn't prepared at all, and there were many
sponsor booths. Besides that, I never even met the organizers.

There were about 400 people, two or three tracks, and a terrible venue. Seriously,
the place was a total disaster, even though it's a newly built conference
center. The sound, the location of rooms, the after-talk areas&mdash;everything
was uncomfortable. Also, the content was not really well-selected. They invited
a few star speakers just because of their names, which is usually a mistake.
The after-party was good, though. It seemed that the organizers tried to do this event
with love, but the venue and speakers, unfortunately, didn't play along.

There were more than 400 people, two days, and four tracks. The venue, the food, and
the transportation were rather good, taking into account the ticket price. Besides
that, the audience was very motivated and engaged. The only downside was a very
short time slot for each talk (30 minutes), very short breaks (10 minutes), and
the number of speakers. It felt too crowded. Aside from that, I would definitely
try to visit again.

The organization was very good. Not perfect, but very good. There were about
300 people and four tracks (I think it's too many). The only problem was
with the content. It looked like they paid too much attention to logistics
and forgot about content. Aside from that, it's definitely a place to see again.

was the number of tracks (too many) and the list of speakers, which I believe

very positive, and I definitely will try to attend it next year.

Surprisingly, the conference was very good. Just two tracks for about 400
attendees, a motivated audience, good equipment, video recording, etc. What I
obviously didn't like was the venue (not really comfortable), the mess with
the schedule (my talk was delayed for more than 30 minutes), and an absence
of focus on a specific subject. Aside from that, it was a positive experience.

It was a rather small conference (around 150 people) without any specific
focus. The venue (Radisson) was perfect, but the number of tracks was too many. There
were fewer than 30 people in my room. Also, the organization was rather messy,
and my talk was delayed for more than 20 minutes.

Even though it's a big (more than 1,000 people) and popular European conference about Java, my
overall impression was not really positive. The venue was not
comfortable at all (it was a cinema), there were no tables for food, and we
were eating lunch in cinema chairs :) The number of talks and tracks was
too many, and the audience was very unfocused. What seriously affected my
impression was the way listeners left the rooms during the talks;
check out this [tweet](https://twitter.com/yegor256/status/731113702691352576).
Besides that, the organization was rather formal and messy. There is a lot

The conference was rather small (around 150 people), but well-organized. What
I didn't really like was the food and the venue. (We even had some other
conference going on in the room next to us.) Also, the audience was not really
engaged nor prepared, as it seemed to me. I believe this event may improve
and become better; the potential is definitely there.

It was an interesting event, mostly because the audience was full
of questions and really interested in project management. The location, the
food, logistics, etc. were good enough. I didn't really like the content
other speakers were delivering, though. I suspect that most of them were invited
there because of their names.

There were about 250 people present. The location was not good at all&mdash;it was a cinema.
Also, the audience was so serious or so shy that it
was rather difficult to present. Not just for me. Also, I got an impression
that speakers were invited just because of their names, not the content they

It was a very big (more than 1,200 people) and a very well-organized
Java conference. The food, the location, the logistics, everything. My
presentation was carefully screened beforehand by the organizers, and I received a few
valuable corrections. The content, I would say, was not so perfect. I would
recommend looking at new names in the industry, and invite those who are less
known but working on something hot and interesting. Besides that, the event
was perfect.

carefully planned in a perfect and rather expensive location. Besides that,
my speech was screened beforehand. I even had to present it over Skype, and some
corrections were received. I would suggest inviting new speakers&mdash;it seems there are almost the same faces every year.

It was a huge event with, I'd guess, more than 1,500 attendees. Even for my presentation,
there were 150 people in the room. The location, the food, the logistics&mdash;everything was good.
The only negative part was a total lack of focus on the
content. Speakers were talking about everything. I didn't even understand
why my presentation was accepted there :)

The event was free to attend but very well-organized. The location was
comfortable, the audience was motivated enough, and the organizers really
cared about the event. The only bad thing was a total absence of speaker
screening. Nobody checked my presentation beforehand, and I can only assume
that the same happened to other speakers.

The organization, food, location, audience, welcoming, and departing were very good, but
the content was rather poor. Most talks were rather boring and poorly prepared.
Aside from that, everything else was good, and I liked being there.

The conference was rather small but well-focused. The audience was actively
engaged and asked a lot of questions. There were about a hundred people at my talk.
The quality of the location was average, and my expenses
were not reimbursed. Also, the content was not really well-prepared or monitored.

There were more than 250 people and just two main tracks&mdash;a good setup.
It was a comfortable location, careful organization, good food, and expenses were
paid. The only problem was the content. Most presentations
were rather boring and not well-prepared. Aside from that, I liked it.

The place was good, the food was very good, the organization was not bad, but
the audience was rather old and out-of-subject. Maybe system engineering is
not really my thing, but most of these guys live somewhere in the 1990s. And there
were fewer than a hundred people for four tracks. Just about 20 per
presentation. It's not really a conference but more like a meetup.

Microservices as Chat Bots;

It was a very small conference, with barely 10 (!) people in the room. The
talks were separated into six rooms, with no specific focus on subjects. Moreover,
I don't think they did any preparation of speakers or even selection of them.
Clearly, the event was there only to make money. The lone thing I enjoyed
was the city, one of my favorites,&mdash;Seattle. Aside from that, it was
a time-wasting event for me.

Looks like these DataRobot (the sponsor of the event) guys
care about quality and do this with passion. There were about 180 people at
my speech, and the reaction from the audience was rather active. What this event can improve
on is to pay attention to the preparation of speakers and limit their number
to just four. They had too many (six), and most of the talks were rather boring, overloaded
with text-rich slides. Also, the place should definitely be changed; NSC Olimpiyskiy
is just trash. To be honest, the previous event at Fedoriv Hub was much better
(I would give it an "A").

This was a shame for the entire industry&mdash;a money-making event with
zero attention to quality. Just random speakers, random attendees, random
subjects&mdash;anything that helped them make money selling
tickets.

This was a huge event with, I would say, more than 2,000 participants and almost
no effort from organizers to make it interesting. Talks were mostly
from sponsors promoting their own products or from clowns making a
living by talking about "why writing clean code is important."
Needless to say, they didn't
compensate travel expenses for speakers, even while making a lot of money
on tickets. It was a waste of time and money.

There were about 50 people in the room, most of whom were rather
interested and engaged. The place was comfortable, equipment was of
good quality, and the focus was right on my talk, as I was the only presenter.
I received a number of leads from this event.

The event was rather big, with more than 300 people in the room. However, the audience
was rather passive, and presentations were mostly from sponsors. The event was there
primarily to make money, which is always a downside. The location was rather
bad&mdash;an old Soviet-time hotel.

The place was a total trash pit (small rooms in NSC Olimpiyskiy) with bad lighting,
bad sound, and a lack of proper ventilation. There was no preparation of talks
or any communication with speakers. These guys are just making money
in a hyped market. It's a shame.

It was a rather small event, but participants were active. Agile is in general
a very boring subject; maybe that's why the event was also rather slow, despite
all the attempts of organizers to make it fun.
