I'm Yegor Bugayenko (Russian:
<span lang="ru" xml:lang="ru">Ег&#x43E;&#x301;р Буга&#x435;&#x301;нко</span>),
a programmer, founder, investor, and philanthropist.

Update: Since September 2019 I'm a Director of System Programming Laboratory
in [Huawei](https://www.huawei.com)
[RRI](https://career.huawei.ru/rri/).

I was a **founder** and CEO of [Zerocracy](https://www.zerocracy.com/),
a software engineering and management platform with an absolutely unique
methodology called [XDSD](https://www.xdsd.org) (watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EytYc7K5JA)).
Most of the ideas behind the methodology I explained in my book [Code Ahead](/code-ahead.html).
I'm the author of a few patent applications, including
[Puzzle-Driven Development (PDD) Method and Software](https://www.google.com/patents/US20120023476)
and
[Method for Software Cost Estimating Using Scope Champions](https://www.google.com/patents/US20100042968).
I'm a certified Project Management Professional
([PMP&reg;](/pdf/certifications/PMP-Jun07.pdf)).
Besides that, I'm a proud holder of
[RUP 7](/pdf/certifications/RUP-Feb07.pdf),
[PRINCE2 Foundation](/pdf/certifications/PRINCE2-Jun08.pdf),
[MCP](/pdf/certifications/MCP-Oct07.pdf),
and
[COSMIC](http://www.cosmicon.com/certificateHoldersV3.asp) certificates.

I am a **programmer**, I [write](https://github.com/yegor256)
mostly in Java, but also in Ruby, PHP, and JavaScript (watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGcCcxx4xrg)).
I'm the founder and lead architect of
[Zold](https://www.zold.io),
[Cactoos](http://www.cactoos.org),
[Takes](http://www.takes.org),
[Rultor](https://www.rultor.com),
and [a few others](/pets.html).
You can sponsor me on [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/yegor256).
Here are [my favorite books]({% pst 2015/apr/2015-04-22-favorite-software-books %})
about software engineering, and a detailed description of
[my work environment]({% pst 2017/jun/2017-06-27-my-environment %}).
I'm an Oracle Certified Master and Java EE 6 Enterprise Architect
([OCMEA](/pdf/certifications/OCMJEA-Feb11.pdf)).
Besides that, I'm a proud holder of
[ZCE](/pdf/certifications/PHP5-Jul08.pdf),
[ZFCE](/pdf/certifications/ZFCE-Oct09.pdf), and
[OCUP](/pdf/certifications/OCUP-Sep08.pdf) certifications.
I've also written a book series about object-oriented programming,
called [Elegant Objects](/elegant-objects.html), plus
[a few other books](/books.html),
and founded [a movement for better OOP](https://elegantobjects.org).

I was an **investor** at [SeedRamp.com](http://www.seedramp.com), I've
made a few investments, but I've got no results yet :)

I am a **philanthropist**, I donate a few thousand dollars every year (started in 2015)
to the best open source project at the time, which I pick myself out of about a hundred in
a more or less fair [competition](/award.html).

I'm also a bit of a [scientist](/papers.html):
[Scopus](https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=30367443600),
[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cYmXh60AAAAJ),
[DBLP](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/hd/b/Bugayenko:Yegor).
Occasionally I teach in
[HSE University](https://www.hse.ru/org/persons/776430466) (Moscow, Russia) 
and in 
Innopolis University (Kazan, Russia).

Here is [my resume](https://latexonline.cc/compile?git=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fyegor256%2Fblog&target=_latex%2Fresume.tex&command=pdflatex&trackId=1520158941887)
and its longer and [boring version](https://latexonline.cc/compile?git=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fyegor256%2Fblog&target=_latex%2Fresume-boring.tex&command=pdflatex&trackId=1520166474432).

Once a month, I send a summary email of my writing activity. If
you're interested in knowing what's going on here, I can add you to my
mailing list. Just give me your email address and briefly explain who you are
and why you're interested (I'm trying to avoid anonymous
subscribers).

<form class="unprintable" action="https://www.mailanes.com/subscribe?list=1" method="POST"><fieldset id="form">

This is my <span style="background-color:#053c5e;color:white;">blue</span> (`#053c5e`).

I also contributed to the development of
[IEEE 730-2014](/pdf/ieee-730-2014.pdf) standard.

BTW, if you wonder why 256, the answer is simple---this is my FIDOnet node ID back from 1995.
I was [2:464/256](http://nodehist.fidonet.org.ua/?address=2%3A464%2F256) over there, and this
is where my network presence has started.
