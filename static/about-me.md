I'm Yegor Bugayenko (Russian:
<span lang="ru" xml:lang="ru">Ег&#x43E;&#x301;р Буга&#x435;&#x301;нко</span>),
a programmer, founder, investor, and philanthropist.

As a **founder** and CEO of [Zerocracy](http://www.zerocracy.com/),
a software engineering and management platform with an absolutely unique
methodology called [XDSD](http://www.xdsd.org) (watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EytYc7K5JA)).
Most of the ideas behind the methodology I explained in my book [Code Ahead](/code-ahead.html).
I'm the author of a few patent applications, including
[Puzzle-Driven Development (PDD) Method and Software](https://www.google.com/patents/US20120023476)
and
[Method for Software Cost Estimating Using Scope Champions](https://www.google.com/patents/US20100042968).
I'm a certified Project Management Professional
([PMP&reg;](http://www.pmi.org/Certification/Project-Management-Professional-PMP.aspx)).
Besides that, I'm a proud holder of
[RUP](http://www-03.ibm.com/certify/certs/38008003.shtml),
[PRINCE2 Foundation](https://www.prince2.com/usa),
[MCP](https://www.mcpvirtualbusinesscard.com/Profile.aspx?ID=df72ca54-8fc9-439a-870c-1b938bd762cf),
and
[COSMIC](http://www.cosmicon.com/certificateHoldersV3.asp) certificates.

As a **programmer**, I [write](https://github.com/yegor256)
mostly in Java, but also in Ruby, PHP, and JavaScript (watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGcCcxx4xrg)).
I'm the founder and lead architect of
[Zold](https://www.zold.io),
[Cactoos](http://www.cactoos.org),
[Takes](http://www.takes.org),
[Rultor](http://www.rultor.com),
and [a few others](/pets.html).
Here are [my favorite books]({% pst 2015/apr/2015-04-22-favorite-software-books %})
about software engineering, and a detailed description of
[my work environment]({% pst 2017/jun/2017-06-27-my-environment %}).
I'm an Oracle Certified Master and Java EE 6 Enterprise Architect
([OCMEA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Certified_Enterprise_Architect)).
Besides that, I'm a proud holder of
[ZCE](http://www.zend.com/en/yellow-pages/ZEND007965),
[ZFCE](http://www.zend.com/en/yellow-pages/ZEND007965), and
[OCUP](http://www.omg.org/uml-certification/) certifications.
I've also written a book series about object-oriented programming,
called [Elegant Objects](/elegant-objects.html), plus
[a few other books](/books.html),
and founded [a movement for better OOP](https://elegantobjects.org).

As an **investor** at [SeedRamp.com](http://www.seedramp.com), I've
made a few investments, but I've got no results yet :)

As a **philanthropist**, I donate a few thousand dollars every year (started in 2015)
to the best open source project at the time, which I pick myself out of about a hundred in
a more or less fair [competition](/award.html).

Here is [my resume](https://latexonline.cc/compile?git=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fyegor256%2Fblog&target=_latex%2Fresume.tex&command=pdflatex&trackId=1520158941887)
and its longer and [boring version](https://latexonline.cc/compile?git=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fyegor256%2Fblog&target=_latex%2Fresume-boring.tex&command=pdflatex&trackId=1520166474432).

Once a month, I send a summary email of my writing activity. If
you're interested in knowing what's going on here, I can add you to my
mailing list. Just give me your email address and briefly explain who you are
and why you're interested (I'm trying to avoid anonymous
subscribers).
