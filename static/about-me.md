I'm Yegor Bugayenko (|jeɪˈɡər buːɡʌˈjenkɒ|, Russian:
<span lang="ru" xml:lang="ru">Ег&#x43E;&#x301;р Ге&#x43E;&#x301;ргиевич Буга&#x435;&#x301;нко</span>),
a programmer, founder, investor, and philanthropist.

Update: Since September 2019, I'm a Software Developer
in [Huawei](https://www.huawei.com)
[RRI](https://career.huawei.ru/rri/).

{% badge /images/about/yegor-speaking.jpg 300 %}

I was a **founder** and CEO of [Zerocracy](https://www.zerocracy.com/),
a software engineering and management platform with an absolutely unique
methodology called [XDSD](https://www.xdsd.org) (watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EytYc7K5JA)).
Most of the ideas behind the methodology I explained in my book [Code Ahead](/code-ahead.html).
I'm the author of a few patent applications, including
[Puzzle-Driven Development (PDD) Method and Software](https://www.google.com/patents/US20120023476)
and
[Method for Software Cost Estimating Using Scope Champions](https://www.google.com/patents/US20100042968).
I'm a certified Project Management Professional
([PMP&reg;](/pdf/certifications/PMP-Jun07.pdf)).
Besides that, I'm a proud holder of
[RUP 7](/pdf/certifications/RUP-Feb07.pdf),
[PRINCE2 Foundation](/pdf/certifications/PRINCE2-Jun08.pdf),
[MCP](/pdf/certifications/MCP-Oct07.pdf),
and
[COSMIC](https://www.cosmicon.com/certificateHoldersV3.asp) certificates.

I am a **programmer**, [writing](https://github.com/yegor256)
mostly in Java, but also in Ruby, Rust, and JavaScript (watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGcCcxx4xrg)).
Also, a founder and lead architect of
[Zold](https://www.zold.io),
[Cactoos](https://www.cactoos.org),
[Takes](https://www.takes.org),
[Rultor](https://www.rultor.com),
and [a few others](/pets.html).
You can sponsor me on [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/yegor256).
Here are [my favorite books]({% pst 2015/apr/2015-04-22-favorite-software-books %})
about software engineering, and a detailed description of
[my work environment]({% pst 2017/jun/2017-06-27-my-environment %}).
Also, an Oracle Certified Master and Java EE 6 Enterprise Architect
([OCMEA](/pdf/certifications/OCMJEA-Feb11.pdf)).
Besides that, a proud holder of
[ZCE](/pdf/certifications/PHP5-Jul08.pdf),
[ZFCE](/pdf/certifications/ZFCE-Oct09.pdf), and
[OCUP](/pdf/certifications/OCUP-Sep08.pdf) certifications.
I've also written a book series about object-oriented programming,
called [Elegant Objects](/elegant-objects.html), plus
[a few other books](/books.html),
and founded [a movement for better OOP](https://elegantobjects.org).

I was an **investor** at [SeedRamp.com](https://www.seedramp.com),
where I've made a few investments, but haven't got any results as of yet.

I am a **philanthropist**, donating a few thousand dollars
every year (started in 2015) to the best open source project at the time,
which we pick out of about a few hundreds in
a more or less fair [competition](https://www.kaicode.org).

I'm also a bit of a [scientist](/papers.html):
[Scopus](https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=30367443600),
[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cYmXh60AAAAJ),
[DBLP](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/hd/b/Bugayenko:Yegor).
Occasionally teaching in
[HSE University](https://www.hse.ru/org/persons/776430466) (Moscow, Russia)
and in
[Innopolis University](https://innopolis.university/en/) (Kazan, Russia).

Here is [my resume][cv] and its longer and [boring version][cv-boring].

Once a month, I send a summary email of my writing activity. If
you're interested in knowing what's going on here, you can join the
mailing list. Just give me your email address and briefly explain who you are
and why you're interested (I'm trying to avoid anonymous
subscribers).

<form class="unprintable" action="https://www.mailanes.com/subscribe?list=1" method="POST"><fieldset id="form">
  <input type="hidden" name="redirect" value="https://www.yegor256.com/subscribed.html"/>
  <label for="email">Your email:</label>
  <input id="email" class="field field-text" tabindex="1" name="email" size="25" maxlength="255" type="email" required="required"/>
  <label for="reason">Who are you and why are you interested:</label>
  <textarea id="reason" style="width:100%;" name="reason" tabindex="2" class="field field-text" rows="6" required="required"></textarea>
  <label for="subscribe">&nbsp;</label>
  <button id="subscribe" class="field" tabindex="3" type="submit">Subscribe</button>
  <span class="note">4865+ happy subscribers and counting...</span>
</fieldset></form>

By the way, this is what some people think about me

Ah, one more thing. I'm a big fan of good movies, so here's
[my list]({% pst 2014/apr/2014-04-06-movies-for-thanasis %}) of the ones
I would recommend you watch. Sometimes, I even make [films](/films.html).

Here is my list of favorite
[fiction](/fiction.html) and [non-fiction](/non-fiction.html) books.

By the way, I'm also an amateur artist,
~~check~~ buy [my paintings](/paintings.html).

I also contributed to the development of

BTW, if you wonder why 256, the answer is simple---this is my
[FIDOnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FidoNet) node ID back from 1995.
I was [2:464/256](http://nodehist.fidonet.org.ua/?address=2%3A464%2F256) over there, and this
is where my network presence has started.
