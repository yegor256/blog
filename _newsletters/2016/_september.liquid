Take a look at these articles published in September:

  * [OOP Without Classes?](https://www.yegor256.com/2016/09/20/oop-without-classes.html)
    raises a question of whether we can have a real
    object-oriented language with only objects and type,
    absolutely without classes (David West, the author or "Object Thinking", also took participation
    in the discussion there).

  * [Inheritance Is a Procedural Technique for Code Reuse](https://www.yegor256.com/2016/09/13/inheritance-is-procedural.html)
    finally demonstrates why I don't like implementation inheritance,
    but find subtyping very useful and important in object-oriented design.

  * [Command, Control, and Innovate](https://www.yegor256.com/2016/09/27/command-control-innovate.html)
    explains why existing traditional management is causing us only
    trouble by ignoring our "original design".

between Baruch Sadogursky and myself, about the future of object-oriented languages
and my experience with Java (took place a few weeks ago in Mountain View, CA).

One more funny thing. I wrote a **new book**, this time not about software
development, but about blogging. I summarized my two years experience of
having a blog and put it into a 200-pages book called
[256 Bloghacks](https://www.yegor256.com/256-bloghacks.html).
All secrets and tricks that I learned up to date are revealed there.
It will be available in Amazon in about three weeks.

Thanks for staying in the mailing list!
