Hope all is well. Here is my monthly newsletter.
This time I would recommend to read these three articles posted recently:

  * [Data Transfer Object Is a Shame](https://www.yegor256.com/2016/07/06/data-transfer-object.html)
    continues the discussion started last year about ORM and explains
    why anemic objects are so wrong in object-oriented programming.

  * [Convince Me!](https://www.yegor256.com/2016/07/21/convince-me.html)
    once again explains the role of a software architect, but from a
    new perspective, claiming that the architect must be a technical
    dictator in the project.

  * [The Law of Demeter Doesn't Mean One Dot](https://www.yegor256.com/2016/07/18/law-of-demeter.html)
    analyzes and criticizes a very famous interpretation
    of the Law of Demeter.

As usually, I will appreciate your comments below my blog posts.

If you're in Silicon Valley, don't miss our second
[Object Thinking](https://www.meetup.com/Object-Thinking/events/232602670/)
meetup in Stanford, on the 9th of August. We'll be discussing static
methods and their negative effect on object-oriented thinking. What is
especially interesting is that this time David West, the author of
[Object Thinking](https://amzn.to/2ass77O) book
(which you must read if you're serious about OOP),
will join us over Skype.

This Wednesday don't miss [Webinar #17](https://www.yegor256.com/webinars.html)
about the role of bugs in software engineering, at 11am PST.

Thanks for staying in the mailing list!
