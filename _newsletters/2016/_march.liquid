Thanks for staying in this mailing list. First of all, good news,
[Elegant Objects](http://goo.gl/W2WVMk) has got a positive response on
Amazon, over 200 copies have been sold already. Please, don't forget to
post your review, if you bought the book, you will help a lot in making it
more popular.

As usual, I would suggest to take a look at these two articles, published recently:

  * [Pimp Up Your Resume](https://www.yegor256.com/2016/03/08/pimp-up-your-resume.html)
    is a full list of what I think a resume of a professional software
    developer must include, to look attractive.

  * [Unspoken Secrets of an Elevator Pitch](https://www.yegor256.com/2016/03/28/unspoken-secrets-of-elevator-pitch.html)
    is a satirical summary of what is wrong with the startup industry. If you've
    ever had any experience with raising capital, you will find
    it fun to read.

Don't miss the second webinar about management, this Wednesday
[at 11am PST](https://plus.google.com/events/cn2nne1qnm8t475bt461igccrg4).
We'll discuss the role of a Software Architect, its authority and obligations.

Also, in a few weeks I'll be speaking at two big Java conferences:
[JPoint](http://javapoint.ru/en/) in Moscow on April 23 and
[JETConf](http://jetconf.by/#/yegor_bugayenko) in Minsk on April 25.
I'll be giving away a few copies of [Elegant Objects](http://goo.gl/W2WVMk), mostly to
those who ask most interesting questions. Don't miss a chance.

Thank you for reading and following!
