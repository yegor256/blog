My monthly newsletter is here. Hope I don't bother you too much. This time,
a few new blog posts for you to read:

  * [How to Hire a Programmer](https://www.yegor256.com/2016/06/21/how-to-hire-programmer.html)
    is a sarcastic summary of what a "good" project founder
    must take into account while hiring a new programmer.

  * [Singletons Must Die](https://www.yegor256.com/2016/06/27/singletons-must-die.html)
    is a short analysis of what Singletons may be replaced with
    in a properly designed object-oriented software (I do believe you
    know that Singleton is an anti-pattern).

  * [11 Mistakes Conferences Keep Making](https://www.yegor256.com/2016/06/03/conference-mistakes.html)
    is a short summary of what I've seen at the events attended
    this year (32 up to date, in 12 countries).

Besides that, first of all, if you are a Silicon Valley resident, you may be interested
to know that I finally started a series of meetups in Stanford, about
object-oriented programming. They are called "Object Thinking in Silicon Valley"
and the first two-hours meeting will happen on the 12th of July, at 6:30pm, more
[details here](https://www.meetup.com/Object-Thinking-in-Silicon-Valley/events/228145728/)
(just 25 seats, hurry up). Of course, all meetups will be video recorded
and published on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr9qCdqXLm2SU0BIs6d_68Q) (subscribe now!),
but it's much better to attend.

Second, I would recommend to watch this talk about the war
object-oriented programming is in:
[Java vs OOP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hOBfjJ2bpw)
(it's in Russian, with English subtitles). I think, this is one of the
best talks I've given about OOP, up to date. To be honest, this is the only
one I like so far.

Third, I started a chat for OOP adepts, in Gitter:
[yegor256/elegantobjects](https://gitter.im/yegor256/elegantobjects). Join it,
if you're here because of my OOP articles. That's were you can talk in real time
with other OOP fanatics and myself.

Fourth, don't miss a [webinar #16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk9tIqwca3k)
next Wednesday, at 11am PST. We'll discuss "smart" classes and why interfaces
in OOP must be functionality-poor.

Thanks for staying in the mailing list!
