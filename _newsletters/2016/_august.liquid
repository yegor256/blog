The summer is over, hope you don't mind. This is what I posted on the blog in August:

  * [Vertical vs. Horizontal DoR](https://www.yegor256.com/2016/08/30/decomposition-of-responsibility.html)
    introduces a new term "decomposition of responsibility",
    which will seriously help us in the second volume of
    [Elegant Objects](https://www.yegor256.com/elegant-objects.html).

  * [A Distributed Team Delivers Code of Higher Quality](https://www.yegor256.com/2016/08/05/distributed-teams-are-higher-quality.html)
    explains why I believe software teams must
    work remotely if they want to achieve higher quality of code.

  * [What's Wrong With Object-Oriented Programming?](https://www.yegor256.com/2016/08/15/what-is-wrong-object-oriented-programming.html)
    is just a summary of most famous quotes about and against
    object-oriented programming.

The interview with David West (the author of "Object Thinking" book)
was published on YouTube just about a week ago:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-hdZZzMCac (part 1), and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW5K5cJ-AVs (part 2).

Besides that, I updated
[this comparison](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/10/05/ten-hosted-continuous-integration-services.html)
of all continuous integration services that I'm aware of.
Now it mentions Shippable, Travis, AppVeyor, and Wercker as top four.

Next Wednesday don't miss [Webinar #18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q0cNykXB04)
about the role of bugs in software engineering, at
[11am PST](https://www.google.com/calendar/event?action=TEMPLATE&dates=20160907T180000Z%2f20160907T190000Z&sprop=website:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D_Q0cNykXB04&text=Printers%20Instead%20of%20Getters%20(webinar)&location=YouTube&details=Webinar%20%2318%20by%20Yegor%20Bugayenko%2C%20click%20here%20to%20join%3A%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D_Q0cNykXB04)
(click here for Google event).

One more thing. I started to write a new book, called
[Code Ahead](https://www.yegor256.com/code-ahead.html). It will be about
software development best practices. Should be published in February 2017.
If you're interested to help me review it,
please email: book@yegor256.com.

Thanks for staying in the mailing list!
