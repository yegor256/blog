Hope you're doing great. I would recommend to check these two articles
from my blog, published in May:

  * [Who Is a Project Manager?](https://www.yegor256.com/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html)
    summarizes my understanding of project management and
    the role of its main guy, the PM.

  * [Test Methods Must Share Nothing](https://www.yegor256.com/2016/05/03/test-methods-must-share-nothing.html)
    is suggesting how to avoid code duplication
    in unit tests without sharing data between them,
    which is a typical and terrible mistake we all keep making.

You may like these two conference talks:
[How Immutability Helps in OOP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnhRgXrHCC4) (46 min, JEEConf, Kyiv)
and
[Need It Robust? Make It Fragile!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCGBgI1MNwE) (43 min, DEVit, Thessaloniki).
At the first one I explained why immutable objects are a very good thing
in object-oriented programming and how wrong very popular books are about OOP.
At the second one I gave a few practical examples of Fail Fast approach
and suggested to design software in a very fragile way to make it more stable.

Thank you for reading and watching!
