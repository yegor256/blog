Hope you're enjoying the beginning of this leap year. Me too.
In less than three weeks my first book
[Elegant Objects](https://www.yegor256.com/elegant-objects.html)
will be published
[on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Elegant-Objects-Yegor-Bugayenko/dp/1519166915/).
Don't miss it!

Besides that, here is what I would recommend to read on the blog:

  * [How Do You Punish Your Employees?](https://www.yegor256.com/2016/01/05/how-to-punish-employees.html)
    is a sarcastic summary of the most popular and at the same time
    the most ugly methods of management.

  * [Defensive Programming via Validating Decorators](https://www.yegor256.com/2016/01/26/defensive-programming.html)
    suggests an alternative way of validating method arguments,
    which makes code cleaner and classes smaller.

Don't forget to attend a monthly webinar on Wednesday,
[at 11am PST](https://plus.google.com/events/csfss5361pqvfkm8ot47d699cu0).
This time we'll talk about project management and its dark side,
also known as Daily Stand Ups.

Thanks for staying tuned!
