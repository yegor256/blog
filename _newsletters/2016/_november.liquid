I didn't email you last month, because there was almost nothing to share: I
had a rather long vacation. I'm back to work and there are some interesting news for you:
we started the development of a new programming language, its
name is [EO](https://www.eolang.org)
(after Elegant Objects and Esperanto). It will be truly
object-oriented, without any compromises (read its [README](https://github.com/yegor256/eo)),
and your contribution will help us make it better.
Please, [join](https://github.com/yegor256/eo/issues).

Also, a few weeks ago, two winners of my Software Quality Award got
their checks ($2,048 each) for their open source projects:
[pholser/junit-quickcheck](https://github.com/pholser/junit-quickcheck)
by [@pholser](https://github.com/pholser)
and [coala/coala](https://github.com/coala/coala)
by [@sils](https://github.com/sils). You may be interested to watch
[this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXLOxZ6Fs4) from
TopConf (Tallinn, Estonia, two few weeks ago), where I explained how
I run this competition and what is so important about it for the software
community. Don't hesitate [to submit](https://www.yegor256.com/2016/10/23/award-2017.html)
your project to the next year round.

Aside from that, I wrote an article about "naked data":
[Encapsulation Covers Up Naked Data](https://www.yegor256.com/2016/11/21/naked-data.html).
I'm using this new term in object-oriented programming to identify
the problem of data being too visible and accessible. This, I believe,
is the key problem in current understanding of OOP. We keep discussing this
in [our Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/yegor256/elegantobjects) too, feel free to join.

This Wednesday don't miss [Webinar #19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaKTNK8g2-M)
about the role of a project manager and its obligations, at
[11am PST](https://www.google.com/calendar/event?action=TEMPLATE&dates=20161207T180000Z%2f20161207T190000Z&sprop=website:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DzaKTNK8g2-M&text=Who%20Is%20a%20Project%20Manager%20(webinar)&location=YouTube&details=Webinar%20%2319%20by%20Yegor%20Bugayenko%2C%20click%20here%20to%20join%3A%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DzaKTNK8g2-M)
(click here for a Google event).

You may also be interested to watch [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1lA7pN60xg)
from BuildStuff (Kyiv, Ukraine, a week ago), where I explain why
a software architect must be a technical dictator and what's so
wrong about team responsibility. Also, watch [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCr9dtGdi2c)
from XP Days (Kyiv, Ukraine, a month ago), where a lot of details
about XDSD, our management model, were disclosed.

One more thing: the winter is here, congratulations!
