Spring is here! Hope the weather is fine where you're now.
I've got some news for you and two articles to read. First of all,
my book [Elegant Objects](https://www.yegor256.com/elegant-objects.html)
was published about a week ago and you can buy it
[on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1519166915/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1519166915&linkCode=as2&tag=yegor256com-20&linkId=RMGEO4ESPM4CGD3O).
Paper-only, no electronic version. Why? I explained it
[here](https://www.yegor256.com/elegant-objects.html). If you decide to buy
and read it, please post your review on Amazon. That will be very helpful!

Second, these two articles are worth reading:

  * [Are You Still Debugging?](https://www.yegor256.com/2016/02/09/are-you-still-debugging.html)
    is a comparison of unit testing and debugging. I'm basically
    claiming there that debugging has no place in a toolbox
    of a professional programmer.

  * [Holacracy or Autocracy? Both!](https://www.yegor256.com/2016/02/18/holacracy-autocracy.html)
    is a philosophical comparison of two management models. I'm starting
    to think about a book on management and this article is one
    of the first steps towards that direction.

As usual, there is a webinar tomorrow,
[at 11am PST](https://plus.google.com/events/csfss5361pqvfkm8ot47d699cu0).
This time it will be a full hour of Java coding. I will demonstrate
how we can create a fully working web application using Takes Framework.
A spoiler: we will be creating a new CDN service.

I spoke at four conferences in February, and will be speaking at two in March.
My full schedule is [here](https://www.yegor256.com/talks.html). Meet me
[in Seattle](http://casitconf.org/casitconf16/talks/) on March 12 and
[in Washington DC](https://www.sedcconference.org/) on March 31.
Thanks for staying tuned!
