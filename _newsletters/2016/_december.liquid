Happy New Year! Hope it was a productive one for you. And I also
wish you the next one to be even better.

I would recommend you to read these articles I wrote recently:

  * [How to Pay Programmers Less](https://www.yegor256.com/2016/12/06/how-to-pay-programmers-less.html)
    was a sarcastic analysis of modern management methods, which caught
    a lot of attention on
    [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/5gtd0k/how_to_pay_programmers_less/),
    [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13120114),
    [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/a/read/1506366442), etc.
    You will definitely find it funny.

  * [MVC vs OOP](https://www.yegor256.com/2016/12/13/mvc-vs-oop.html)
    explained why I thought that a very popular
    Model-View-Controller design pattern was actually an anti-pattern
    for object-oriented design.

  * [Can Objects Be Friends?](https://www.yegor256.com/2016/12/20/can-objects-be-friends.html)
    suggested a solution for the
    [naked data](https://www.yegor256.com/2016/11/21/naked-data.html)
    problem in object-oriented programming, explained earlier.

Next Wednesday don't miss [Webinar #20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVvLQGnyDrQ)

[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EytYc7K5JA)
from [DevTernity](https://devternity.com/) (Riga, Latvia), where
I explained how we develop software in an extremely distributed mode
and what are the benefits this model g. According to reviews, it was one of
the best presentations about [XDSD](https://www.xdsd.org).

One more thing: I need volunteers. First of all, I need Java and Ruby
developers for a few open source projects of mine. Mostly for
supervising and maintaining their existing architecture. Second, I need help in
finding sponsors for my [quality award](https://www.yegor256.com/award.html):
let's get in touch with that big software companies and make them
donate a few thousand dollars for good. Please reply back if interested.

One last thing: I'm working on a new project, which will be launched in
invite-only beta mode in about two months. If interested in becoming
an early adopter and getting a three-months trial package (worth over $3,000),
