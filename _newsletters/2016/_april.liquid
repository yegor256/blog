Hope all is good! Thanks for reading my updates, this is
yet another one. I've recently published three new blogs about OOP, which
I highly recommend to read:

  * [Printers Instead of Getters](https://www.yegor256.com/2016/04/05/printers-instead-of-getters.html)
    explains what to do when we don't want to use getters but still
    need our objects to "return" some data.

  * [Java Annotations Are a Big Mistake](https://www.yegor256.com/2016/04/12/java-annotations-are-evil.html)
    claims that object consistency is ruined when we use
    annotations in Java and suggests a few better solutions.

  * [Object Behavior Must Not Be Configurable](https://www.yegor256.com/2016/04/19/object-must-not-be-configurable.html)
    recommends to make objects solid and use decorators
    in order to change their behavior.

These three blogs will be turned into sections of [Elegant Objects](https://www.yegor256.com/elegant-objects.html)
Volume 2, which I'm working on right now. As with the first volume, I'm
looking for volunteers to help me read the book and critize. Let me know
if interested: [book@yegor256.com](mailto:book@yegor256.com).

Don't miss a webinar about Java annotations this Wednesday
[at 11am PST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1ctRcW214w).

Also, I've attended a few conferences recently. You may be interested to
watch these two talks:
[ORM Is Offensive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aER4uwyFbqQ) at JPoint in Moscow
(in Russian, but English subtitles will be available in a few days)
and
[Blame the Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6r2W3P9vgY) at NextBuild in Eindhoven.

Thank you for reading and watching!
