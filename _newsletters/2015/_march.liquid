There were two important events in the last month that
I want to share with you. First of all, it's a release of
[Takes](https://www.takes.org), a Java web development framework
designed with the principles of "object thinking" in mind. That
same principles I've been writing about over the last year. Takes
doesn't have any NULLs, any mutable objects, any getters/setters
or any class casting. Its design is pure object-oriented, well... as I understand it.

Second, I decided to start monthly webinars, following most interesting and provocative
subjects being discussed on the blog. The first webinar will happen in about
a week, [next Wednesday, the 8th of April, at 11am PST](https://plus.google.com/events/c5mesunno48ol40p5101sufnfm0).
It's going to be a one-hour online discussion of static methods and
their object-oriented alternatives. The topic is based on this article,
published earlier: [Composable Decorators vs. Imperative Utility Methods](https://www.yegor256.com/2015/02/26/composable-decorators.html).

Besides that, I would recommend to read this article:
[Team Morale: Myths and Reality](https://www.yegor256.com/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html).
It is about team spirit, leadership, and management BS. Would be interesting
to hear your thoughts, as usual, in comments under the article.

Thanks for reading and following!
