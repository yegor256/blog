Happy New Year! Hope, your 2015 was productive and you enjoyed it.
Wish you interesting projects in 2016, full of challenges and solutions.

I would recommend to read these December blog posts:

  * [Temporal Coupling Between Method Calls](https://www.yegor256.com/2015/12/08/temporal-coupling-between-method-calls.html)
    summarizes what I see very often in our pull requests and
    explains why I think it's a bad thing&mdash;temporal coupling.

  * [Why Don't You Contribute to Open Source?](https://www.yegor256.com/2015/12/22/why-dont-you-contribute-to-open-source.html)
    explains my understanding of "passion" in software development
    and its relation to open source contribution.

It's important to mention that we started a new project,
[SeedRamp](https://www.seedramp.com), a venture fund. We are going
to make micro-investments (up to $20,000) in young startups,
in the US, just after a one-hour interview. Take a look and don't
hesitate to apply.

I've got a few invitations recently, to give lectures about OOP
and project management. That's why I decided to make it official:
[lectures in your office](https://www.yegor256.com/lectures.html). In a nutshell,
if I'm somewhere close to your city, invite me and I'll give a one-hour
lecture about one of the subjects covered in the blog. It's free. All you have
to do is to organize video/photo recording.

As always, don't forget to attend a monthly webinar on Wednesday,
[at 11am PST](https://plus.google.com/u/0/events/c2l3nfnkkmfg01e2gvoks028a1c).
We'll discuss a very famous design pattern, called ORM, and I'll try to prove
that it's actually an anti-pattern.

Thanks for reading!
