Hope you're ready for the coming winter. A few months ago I wrote a book about
object-oriented programming and planning to publish it in January. It is
called [**Elegant Objects**](https://www.yegor256.com/elegant-objects.html)
and I need your help in reviewing it. Please,
[apply](https://www.yegor256.com/elegant-objects.html)
if you have time to help.

This is what I've published over the last month, which is worth reading:

  * [A Chatbot Is Better Than a UI for a Microservice](https://www.yegor256.com/2015/11/03/chatbot-better-than-ui-for-microservice.html)
    explains how [rultor](https://www.rultor.com), a DevOps chatbot we're
    using in all [our projects](https://www.teamed.io), is designed, and why this approach
    is the future, in my opinion. Well, at least for micro web services.
    I also spoke about this idea at BuildStuff Ukraine, in Kyiv, a few
    weeks ago, video is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUil-aTImgU).

  * [10 Typical Mistakes in Specs](https://www.yegor256.com/2015/11/10/ten-mistakes-in-specs.html)
    is basically a summary of all advices I can give for a requirements
    engineer, to help making specifications cleaner and more readable. Just
    take a look, I'm sure it will resonate with what you have in your projects.

  * [Imprisonment for Irresponsible Coding!](https://www.yegor256.com/2015/11/24/imprisonment-for-irresponsible-coding.html)
    is a call for justice for those who are still using anti-patterns
    and writing unmaintainable code. The post is mostly a joke, but, I believe,
    the idea is not as crazy as it sounds.

Also, a few weeks ago I had a workshop in Berlin, at [DATFlock2015](http://distributed-agile-teams.org/workshops/),
about Ringelmann Effect and its applicability to Agile.
[This article](https://www.yegor256.com/2015/11/21/ringelmann-effect-vs-agile.html)
summarizes the outcomes, take a look.

Besides that, I spoke at DevOpsDays Warsaw about Continuous Integration
and its very typical negative effects. Photos
[are here](https://www.facebook.com/yegor.bugayenko/posts/10208114809057924), video is coming
(just follow [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/technoparkcorp)
and you will get it soon).

And don't forget to attend a one-hour webinar tomorrow, as usual
[at 11am PST](https://plus.google.com/u/0/events/c6pfo5ku07kd5a92dgrmj5b1o6g).
We'll discuss Dependency Injection and why DI container is an anti-pattern.

Thanks for staying in the list!
