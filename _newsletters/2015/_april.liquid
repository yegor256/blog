This month there were two important events that
I have to share with you. First of all, it's a release of
[Tacit](https://github.com/yegor256/tacit), a CSS framework "for dummies"
that doesn't have any CSS classes but solely relies on standard HTML5 elements
and their default attributes. Tacit got some traction already on
[GitHub](https://github.com/yegor256/tacit/stargazers)
and [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9345271), here is a post about it:
[Tacit, a CSS Framework Without Classes](https://www.yegor256.com/2015/04/13/tacit-css-framework-for-dummies.html).

Second, I announced a [Software Quality Award](https://www.yegor256.com/award.html)
for the best open source project, according to my own criteria of quality.
Submit your project, let me review it and on the 15th of October you have
a chance to get **$4,096**.

Besides that, [next Wednesday, the 6th of May, at 11am PST](https://plus.google.com/events/ce8vv0tp2ri3p5gm7k6m4ban5d0),
watch my second webinar, about immutable objects, their pitfalls and benefits, according to two
previously published articles:
[Objects Should Be Immutable](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/06/09/objects-should-be-immutable.html) and
[Immutable Objects Are Not Dumb](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/12/22/immutable-objects-not-dumb.html).

Also, I published a list of my
[favorite 16 software books](https://www.yegor256.com/2015/04/22/favorite-software-books.html).
Hope you read and enjoy them too.

That's all for April :) Thanks for reading and watching!
