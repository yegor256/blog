Hope everything is good and you're enjoying this summer. If you're
in front of a computer, I would recommend to look at these two articles
I've written over the last month:

 * [Checked vs. Unchecked Exceptions: The Debate Is Not Over](https://www.yegor256.com/2015/07/28/checked-vs-unchecked-exceptions.html)
   explains my view of this very old and very well discussed problem. I believe
   that all exceptions must be "checked", in a proper OOP design. No surprise,
   there are over 50 comments already under the post.

 * [Meetings Are Legalized Robbery](https://www.yegor256.com/2015/07/13/meetings-are-legalized-robbery.html)
   is about my understanding of meetings in software development business
   and their negative (!) effect on productivity.

Don't forget to attend a webinar next week, on Wednesday, as usual
[at 11am PST](https://plus.google.com/events/cftrih1qol7h1q8sdprcbuv0c9g). I'll
talk about class naming problem&mdash;how to make up a good name for a class.
Apparently, it's not as easy as it seems.

Thanks for staying in the list.
