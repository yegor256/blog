Hope you had a good Halloween party yesterday, if you celebrate
this 400+ years old [Celtic holiday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween)
in your part of the world. This is what I'd recommend to read, after the party:

  * [Why Software Outsourcing Doesn't Work ... Anymore](https://www.yegor256.com/2015/10/27/outsourcing-doesnt-work.html)
    explains why outsourcing was a great business ten years
    ago and is not any more (there was some flame
    [on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10463195) about it, check it out).

  * [How to Be a Good Office Slave](https://www.yegor256.com/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html)
    screams about a very common situation in most companies
    and offices, where we have to work to please someone, instead
    of achieving real business goals.

  * [Vertical and Horizontal Decorating](https://www.yegor256.com/2015/10/01/vertical-horizontal-decorating.html)
    briefly demonstrates two approaches to object
    decorating and provokes some discussion in that direction.

Also, two weeks ago a winner was announced at my
[Quality Award](https://www.yegor256.com/2015/04/16/award.html). It was
[`gvlasov/inflectible`](https://github.com/gvlasov/inflectible), a Java project.
As promised, I paid $4,096 to [`@gvlasov`](https://github.com/gvlasov), the winner.
So, I'm officially a philanthropist now.
You are welcome to submit your project to the
[next year competition](https://www.yegor256.com/2015/10/17/award-2016.html).

Don't forget to attend a webinar on Wednesday, as usual
[at 11am PST](https://plus.google.com/u/0/events/cl4ugsfapl84d086gpihqq5c49k).
We'll discuss so called "fake objects" and their usefulness in OOP libraries.

Thanks for staying tuned!
