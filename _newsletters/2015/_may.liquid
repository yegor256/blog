It was a busy month... Among others, these three articles are worth reading:

 * [A Few Thoughts on Unit Test Scaffolding](https://www.yegor256.com/2015/05/25/unit-test-scaffolding.html)
   argues about JUnit fixtures and their better alternatives in
   true object-oriented world.

 * [Three Things I Expect From a Software Architect](https://www.yegor256.com/2015/05/11/software-architect-responsibilities.html)
   explains my understanding of a software architect role
   and its responsibilities in front of a project manager.

 * [Constructors Must Be Code-Free](https://www.yegor256.com/2015/05/07/ctors-must-be-code-free.html)
   suggests to keep constructors in OOP as light-weight as possible,
   preferably without any statements except assignments.

By the way, surprisingly, the [Software Quality Award](https://www.yegor256.com/award.html)
announced last month, already received over 120 submissions and the number
is growing. Don't hesitate to submit your project!

As usual, don't forget about a monthly webinar,
[this Wednesday, the 3rd of June, at 11am PST](https://plus.google.com/events/cnt6o73pqehec7dqqeuvlev7ff4),
about NULL references and their usage in object-oriented world.

That's all, enjoy the sun!
