Hope everything is fine and you are not too sad to see this summer going.
There were two articles published on the blog over the last month,
which I would recommend you to look at:

 * [Need Robust Software? Make It Fragile](https://www.yegor256.com/2015/08/25/fail-fast.html)
   is about "Fail Fast" philosophy and its application to low-level
   design in Java.

 * [Why Many Return Statements Are a Bad Idea in OOP](https://www.yegor256.com/2015/08/18/multiple-return-statements-in-oop.html)
   explains my take on a "single return point" idea in
   object-orieted programming and argues in its favor.

Don't forget to attend a webinar tomorrow, as usual
[at 11am PST](https://plus.google.com/events/cn31s82dkejqo3pfetttq8mrgb0). We'll
discuss utility classes and why they are evil in OOP.

Thanks for reading my blog :)
