Hope you're enjoying this summer. Here is a brief update on my recent blogging
activity:

 * [Seven Deadly Sins of a Software Project](https://www.yegor256.com/2015/06/08/deadly-sins-software-project.html)
   was rather popular [on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/396q18/seven_deadly_sins_of_a_software_project/)
   a few weeks ago.
   It summarizes my views on a discipline of software development and outlines
   seven most important and typical problems. Also, these
   criteria will be used in the [Award](https://www.yegor256.com/award.html) in a few months.

 * [How Much For This Software?](https://www.yegor256.com/2015/06/02/how-to-estimate-software-cost.html)
   explains why estimating a software development budget is in most cases
   a bad idea and also suggests an alternative.

 * [Good Programmers Write Bug-Free Code, Don't They?](https://www.yegor256.com/2015/06/18/good-programmers-bug-free.html)
   continues a very popular discussion about the existence of
   bug-free programmers and their value for the industry.

By the way, there are some good news! The [Award](https://www.yegor256.com/award.html)
is now sponsored by **JetBrains**. They will grant eight licenses for their
products to the best eight projects! So, if you haven't submitted your project
yet, hurry up.

And, of course, don't forget to attend a webinar tomorrow
[at 11am PST](https://plus.google.com/events/cabfenpghh36tj413n2p0b4r3kk). This
time it will be about "Getters and Setters" and why they are evil.

Let me know your thoughts and thanks for staying in the list :)
