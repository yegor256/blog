There were eleven posts in total and a few interesting ones among them,
in [the blog](https://www.yegor256.com) last month. I would recommend
paying attention to these three:

 * [Are You a Hacker or a Designer?](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/10/26/hacker-vs-programmer-mentality.html)
   posted most recently claims that the time of "hacker mentality" is fading out
   because computers are getting cheaper and programmers' salaries
   keep growing. It is now the time of the "designer" mentality, which cares
   more about code readability than its performance.

 * [Continuous Integration is Dead](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/10/08/continuous-integration-is-dead.html)
   explains what's wrong with a traditional continuous integration approach
   and how the problem is fixed by a previously explained
   [Read-Only Master Branch](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/07/21/read-only-master-branch.html) approach.

 * [DI Containers are Code Polluters](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/10/03/di-containers-are-evil.html)
   is about depenedency injection containers, like Guice or Spring IoC, and
   their negative effect on code readability.
