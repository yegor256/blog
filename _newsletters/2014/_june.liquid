This is the first monthly update from my blog (www.yegor256.com). If you

The blog is about software development, mostly in Java. I'm writing about
the projects I work on, including those that use Jcabi, ReXSL, Qulice,
Rultor (former FaZend), and many others. By the end of every month,
I summarize everything that has been written during the month and send
you this update email.

Here is list of some of the more interesting posts:

[Objects Should Be Immutable](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/06/09/objects-should-be-immutable.html)
is a provocative writing about why all objects in proper object-oriented
programming should be immutable (and never allowed to modify their
encapsulated data). The article was discussed aggressively at
[reddit](http://redd.it/27o915). You're welcome to share your o
pinion there or in the blog comments.

[AOP Aspects Method Logging](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/06/01/aop-aspectj-java-method-logging.html)
gives detailed introductions for [jcabi-aspects](http://aspects.jcabi.com),
which is a library we've been working with for the last two years. One of
its nicest features&mdash;automatic logging of every call to annotated Java methods.

[XML+XSLT in Browser](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/06/25/xml-and-xslt-in-browser.html)
explains the idea of detaching data from presentation in web through
the use of XSL stylesheets. I tried to explain why I like this approach
and why [ReXSL framework](https://www.rexsl.com) was created three years ago.
I'm going to write more about this subject, this is just a start :)

Besides that, there were other articles that you can find yourself
[on the blog](https://www.yegor256.com) :)

Thank You for reading!
