Hope you all are enjoying this summer :) Here is what I mostly wrote about
in [my blog](https://www.yegor256.com) this August:

 * "Release in One Click" stories that explain how
   we deploy our products to:
   [Maven Central](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/08/19/how-to-release-to-maven-central.html),
   [RubyGems](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/08/26/publish-to-rubygems.html), and
   [CloudBees](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/08/25/deploy-to-cloudbees.html)
   using [rultor.com](https://www.rultor.com). These articles are rather
   technical, but they cover the entire "continuous delivery" workflow,
   from the very start up until that final "new version released!" tweet.

 * [Strict Control of Java Code Quality](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/08/13/strict-code-quality-control.html)
   is an introductory article for
   [qulice.com](https://www.qulice.com), an open source product we've been using
   and improving since 2011.

Besides that, I started to write book reviews. Hopefully they will
be both interesting to read and encourage you to buy the books reviewed and read
them in full. I only write about books I enjoy(ed) reading.
The first review is about
"[The Art of Software Testing](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/08/22/art-of-software-testing.html),"
by Glenford Myers. As I say in the review, this book is one of my favorites. Give it a try -
it will change your vision. Well, it should :)

Thanks for staying in my list of subscribers!
