Basically, there were two interesting articles published in
[the blog](https://www.yegor256.com) last month:

 * [Getters/Setters. Evil. Period.](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/09/16/getters-and-setters-are-evil.html)
   argues why there is no place for methods prefixed with
   "get" or "set" in an ideal object-oriented world.

 * [Why Monetary Awards Don't Work?](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/09/24/why-monetary-awards-dont-work.html)
   explains why cash may become either a very effective
   motivating instrument in your team or something that will ruin its entire "team spirit".
   There is also an experimental video attached to the article :)

A few weeks ago I also joined the JavaCodeGeeks community and got
some interesting feedback from its readers, especially
on my articles about
[Why NULL is bad](https://www.javacodegeeks.com/2014/09/why-null-is-bad.html) and
[Typical Mistakes in Java Code](https://www.javacodegeeks.com/2014/09/typical-mistakes-in-java-code.html).
Feel free to add your comments there.
