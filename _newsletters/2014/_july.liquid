July was mostly dedicated to the rebirth of
[Rultor.com](https://www.rultor.com), which is
a hosted continuous delivery service.

It was created a year ago, but in a preliminary and rather
heavyweight version. We were using it successfully for a year,
but with multiple problems and maintenance difficulties.
Over-engineering is a very common disease, you know :)

Over the last month, I re-wrote it almost from scratch. Now it
works amazingly smoothly. I've published a few articles about
it in [my blog](https://www.yegor256.com). The most interesting are these two:

 * [Rultor.com, a Merging Bot](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/07/24/rultor-automated-merging.html),
   which explains how Rultor helps in automated merging of pull requests in
   GitHub and how [Docker containers](https://doc.rultor.com/docker.html)
   help us isolate builds.

 * [Rultor + Travis](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/07/31/travis-and-rultor.html)
   gives a lot of technical details about
   Rultor usage in open source GitHub projects. Also, it gives
   a few real-life examples of combining  Rultor with
   [Travis](http://travis-ci.org).

BTW, I would appreciate if you reply to this email with some
short feedback about what you think I should improve. I mean,
maybe something is boring to read or something is missing.
Your feedback is very welcome :)
