I'm sure I will surprise you, but I recently changed my mind: procedural
programming is actually _better_ than object-oriented. That means that
getters-and-setters, static methods and, of course, Singleton design pattern
are good things, not evil, like I was saying before.
Having that in mind I wrote three articles in the last month:

  * [The TDD That Works for Me](https://www.yegor256.com/2017/03/24/tdd-that-works.html)
    is a criticism of a classic tests-first approach and a discussion of how
    tests can really help if we do it tests-last and then tests-first.

  * [Traits and Mixins Are Not OOP](https://www.yegor256.com/2017/03/07/traits-and-mixins.html)
    is a quick overview of a rather popular and at the same time
    very wrong technique of code reuse, in Ruby, PHP, Java and other languages.

  * [SOLID Is OOP for Dummies](https://www.yegor256.com/2017/03/28/solid.html)
    adds my few cents to this very popular set of design principles.

Don't miss [Webinar #23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nm274dGikFc) next week
about Puzzle Driven Development, the methodology that helps us automate programming, at
[11am PST](https://www.google.com/calendar/event?action=TEMPLATE&dates=20170406T190000Z/20170406T200000Z&sprop=website:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=%23%7B@id%7D&text=Puzzle%20Driven%20Development%20(webinar%20%2323)&location=YouTube%20Live&details=Webinar%20%2323%20by%20Yegor%20Bugayenko,%20click%20here%20to%20join:%20https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsYGC2aUwfQ)

Don't forget to submit your open source project to
the annual [software quality award](https://www.yegor256.com/award.html).
The prize is $4,096, to be rewarded in November 2017.

I'll be speaking at
[JPoint](https://jpoint.ru/en/talks/java-annotations-are-a-big-mistake/) (Moscow, Russia)
next week, about Java annotations. If you're still
in doubt whether to attend of not, don't hesitate&mdash;it's one of the best
software events. Also, you will be able
to buy the second volume of Elegant Objects for just $20 if you attend it
(later, once it's published at the end of April).
