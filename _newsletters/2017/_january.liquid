I wrote a few new articles on my blog in January, three of them
I would definitely recommend you to read:

  * [How Much Do You Love Conflict?](https://www.yegor256.com/2017/01/03/how-much-you-love-conflicts.html)
    is a short summary of that famous Win-Win idea and its
    practical application to resolving problems between people
    in a software project.

  * [16 Don'ts of Career Growth](https://www.yegor256.com/2017/01/24/career-advice.html)
    is my summary of what a junior programmer has to do in order to become
    a senior one, with a much bigger salary and a much happier
    smile on his/her face.

  * [Synchronized Decorators to Replace Thread-Safe Classes](https://www.yegor256.com/2017/01/17/synchronized-decorators.html)
    is a quick and primitive object-oriented advice on concurrency in Java, which,
    I'm sure, will be applicable to most situations in your projects
    (pay attention to the comments under the article though).

Aside from that, there is an experiment on my blog:
[video questions and answers](https://www.yegor256.com/video-qa.html). If you
have a question about management in your software project, shoot me an email
and we'll schedule a video call for 10-15 minutes. I will try to answer and help you.
Then, the entire conversation will be on YouTube. I've already got
over a dozen of requests. We'll start making that videos in February.

Also, next Wednesday don't miss [Webinar #21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWLpAZqvqSc)
about conflicts and their importance in a software team (just after
the article recently published), at
[11am PST](https://www.google.com/calendar/event?action=TEMPLATE&dates=20170208T190000Z/20170208T200000Z&sprop=website:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=%23%7B@id%7D&text=How%20to%20Deal%20With%20Conflicts%20in%20a%20Software%20Team%20(webinar%20%2321)&location=YouTube%20Live&details=Webinar%20%2321%20by%20Yegor%20Bugayenko,%20click%20here%20to%20join:%20https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWLpAZqvqSc)
