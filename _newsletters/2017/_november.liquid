Christmas is coming, hope you are ready. Before that, please read these
recent posts on my blog:

  * [How Micro Is Your Tasking?](https://www.yegor256.com/2017/11/28/microtasking.html)
    is a summary of my six-years experience of dealing wtih
    distributed software projects, where micro-tasking was applied.

  * [Five Features to Make Java Even Better](https://www.yegor256.com/2017/11/07/five-new-java-features.html)
    is a sarcastic (!) summary of features Java may need to become "better".

  * [Constructors or Static Factory Methods?](https://www.yegor256.com/2017/11/14/static-factory-methods.html)
    is a long waited negative review of static factory methods suggested by
    Joshua Bloch.

I published a few new episodes of [Shift-M](https://www.yegor256.com/shift-m.html),
my project management podcast.
Don't miss them! Also, I wanted to ask you to suggest me someone who you
think may be an interesting person to interview. Someone from a real management world,
some CTO or a VP of development, who can share his or her real experience
in project management. Do you know anyone? Maybe you current boss?

[Code Ahead](https://www.yegor256.com/code-ahead.html),
my new book about management, is 75% ready. It will be ready by the end of December.

automated testing, at [DotNext 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_2AvKDHAWI)
