Summer is over, this means Christmas is closer! This is what I wrote
in August:

  * [How to Manage a Manager?](https://www.yegor256.com/2017/08/01/how-to-manage-a-manager.html)
    is not a satire, but a very practical advice on how we programmers
    can survive when the management is stupid; speaking out of my personal
    experience.

  * [RAII in Java](https://www.yegor256.com/2017/08/08/raii-in-java.html)
    is a summary of how RAII (an OOP design mechanism from C++) can and must
    be used in Java code, with a practical example.

  * [XCOP---XML Style Checker](https://www.yegor256.com/2017/08/29/xcop.html)
    is an introduction of my new command line tool that checks
    XML documents for prettiness, just like Checkstyle does it for Java
    code and Rubocop for Ruby files.

A month ago I asked you to post Amazon reviews for my book "Elegant Objects"
([vol.1](https://amzn.to/2uRRubs) and [vol.2](https://amzn.to/2vYxgNt)). Some of
you did that, which I truly appreciated. I mailed those supporters these cute
durable cactus stickers. Please, if you haven't reviewed the books yet, do it now
and email me your postal address. I will send you the stickers!

Please, don't forget to submit your open source project to my
[Quality Award](https://www.yegor256.com/2016/10/23/award-2017.html) (the form is there).
Today is the last day! The winner will be announced in the middle of October
and will get $4,096.

I've managed to record two new episodes of Shift-M, my podcast about
management: [no.7](https://www.yegor256.com/shift-m/2017/7.html) about
distributed management (with Hugo Messer) and
[no.8](https://www.yegor256.com/shift-m/2017/8.html)
about how to pay programmers less (just myself).

Don't forget to join my [Telegram group](https://t.me/joinchat/CLxAaUJFMRwu3ju_M3ec6A),
if you want to stay really tuned. Also, remember that there is a
[Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/yegor256/elegantobjects)
where we discuss object-oriented programming and its pitfalls.

The [Webinar #28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYd24FN58wg) will
happen next week on Wednesday, the 6th of September.
We will create a fully functional web app in Java, with the best principles of object-oriented programming in mind, in just one hour. The application will be ThreeCopies.com, an online backup solution for server-side data.
