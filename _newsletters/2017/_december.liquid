As usual, please check these articles I wrote recently on the blog:

  * [Alan Kay Was Wrong About Him Being Wrong](https://www.yegor256.com/2017/12/12/alan-kay-was-wrong.html)
    was a quick summary of what Alan Kay, the inventor of OOP, said
    about objects vs. messages. I was very surprised to see Alan Kay himself
    joining us in the comments zone and answering questions about his vision
    of OOP.

  * [DAO is Yet Another OOP Shame](https://www.yegor256.com/2017/12/05/data-access-object.html)
    is a criticism of a very popular design pattern in the area of
    persistence.

  * [The Formula for Software Quality](https://www.yegor256.com/2017/12/26/software-quality-formula.html)
    is a semi-philosophical suggestion for how we can measure the
    result we produce as software teams.

[Code Ahead](https://www.yegor256.com/code-ahead.html),
my new book about management, is ready. I need your help in reviewing it before
it's published. Please, fill out
