Spring is here! Don't get scared: the season, not the framework.
I wrote a few new articles last month, check them out:

  * [Why I Don't Talk to Google Recruiters](https://www.yegor256.com/2017/02/21/say-no-to-google-recruiters.html)
    tells a true story of me trying and failing to become
    an Amazon employee two years ago; this short article got a lot of
    polarized reaction on
    [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13696004) and
    [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/5vc1ul/why_i_dont_talk_to_google_recruiters/) last week.

  * [Each Private Static Method Is a Candidate for a New Class](https://www.yegor256.com/2017/02/07/private-method-is-new-class.html)
    claims that most static methods may be perfectly replaced
    by objects, to improve readability and reusability of code.

  * [Stack Overflow Is Your Mandatory Tool](https://www.yegor256.com/2017/02/14/stackoverflow-is-your-tool.html)
    answers a very commonly asked question about the importance
    of Stack Overflow profile reputation for a resume of a software developer;
    read it if you're still in doubt.

More good news: I finished writing the second volume of
[Elegant Objects](https://www.yegor256.com/elegant-objects.html). Now
it's under review of 10 volunteers. They will finish in a few weeks, I will
make final changes, and the book will be available for purchase on Amazon
in just a few weeks. Stay tuned!

We ran an experimental
[Video Q&A](https://www.yegor256.com/video-qa.html) last month and four
questions about management were asked. You're welcome to watch
[our discussions](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaIsQH4uc08w6n3bGt6dJKhk2SCORdBKj)
and email me back to ask your questions.
