I hope you didn't miss the Halloween party yesterday. Time to get back to work.
This is what I would recommend you to read on my blog:

  * [Java 9: The Good, The Bad, and Private Interface Methods](https://www.yegor256.com/2017/10/03/java9.html)
    is a critical review of Java&nbsp;9 and its features.

  * [Streams vs. Decorators](https://www.yegor256.com/2017/10/10/streams-vs-decorators.html)
    explains why I'm not a big fan of Streams API in Java and how I
    would recommend to use decorators instead.

  * [Lazy Loading and Caching via Sticky Cactoos Primitives](https://www.yegor256.com/2017/10/17/lazy-loading-caching-sticky-cactoos.html)
    is a quick explanation of a very effective "design pattern"
    I just discovered with the help of [Cactoos](https://www.cactoos.org).

A week ago I [announced](https://www.yegor256.com/2016/10/23/award-2017.html)
the winners in my annual Quality Award and paid
each of them $1,024:
[@itcraftsmanpl](https://github.com/itcraftsmanpl) and [@mafagafogigante](https://github.com/mafagafogigante)
with [php-ml](https://github.com/php-ai/php-ml) (PHP)
and [dungeon](https://github.com/mafagafogigante/dungeon) (Java) projects.
Today (!) you can join my [webinar #29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z70PMGaxGhY),
where I will explain how this competition works and how you can win
[next year](https://www.yegor256.com/2017/10/24/award-2018.html).

to add it to the calendar.

Also, two weeks ago, I started a new open source project: [jpeek](https://www.jpeek.org).
It's a static code analyzer. It's going to collect different metrics
from Java classes and build summary reports. Later, with a big set
of metrics, we'll be able to compare different popular Java libraries with
the code written with "Elegant Objects" approach in mind and understand where
the quality is higher. I welcome you to [participate](https://github.com/yegor256/jpeek/issues).

One more thing. I signed a contract with a [Ji&nbsp;&&nbsp;Son](http://jiandson.co.kr/) book publisher
for a translation and publishing of my
"[Elegant Objects"](https://www.yegor256.com/elegant-objects.html)" book (vol.1) in South Korea.
In a few months it will be on the market.
