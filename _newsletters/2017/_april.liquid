There were not so many articles in April, but two new small projects
were launched instead:

[0pdd.com](https://www.0pdd.com): a hosted cloud service that
helps you automate Puzzle Driven Development (we discussed it
in [Webinar #23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsYGC2aUwfQ))
in your GitHub repository.
The blog post [PDD in Action](https://www.yegor256.com/2017/04/05/pdd-in-action.html)
explained how it works. It is open source and free of charge. Try it
out in your own project.

[sixnines.io](https://www.sixnines.io): a hosted service that
regularly checks the status of your website and measures its
"availability"&mdash;a very important non-functional metric. The
blog post [SixNines.io, Your Website Availability Monitor](https://www.yegor256.com/2017/04/25/sixnines.html)
described how you can get a nice looking badge for your website:
