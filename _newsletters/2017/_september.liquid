Hope you're having a good weekend, let me disturb you with this monthly newsletter.
You may like these three articles I wrote recently:

  * [Yet Another Evil Suffix For Object Names: Client](https://www.yegor256.com/2017/09/12/evil-object-name-suffix-client.html)
    suggests to get rid of "clients" in object-oriented code
    and stick to objects that represent server-side entities.

  * [What Motivates Me as a Programmer](https://www.yegor256.com/2017/09/19/what-motivates-me.html)
    explains what is important for me in a company, if I work there
    as a programmer on a payroll, also what is not important at all.

  * [ThreeCopies.comâ€”Server-Side Data Backup Service](https://www.yegor256.com/2017/09/26/threecopies-server-data-backup.html)
    is an announcement of [ThreeCopies](https://www.threecopies.com) (my new pet project),
    a light-weight hosted solution for regular backups of server-side data.

Besides that, I'm now actively working on my next book:
[Code Ahead](https://www.yegor256.com/code-ahead.html). It's a fiction prose
about a programmer who joins a software team and finds out that there
are many things going wrong. He is trying to fix some of them, but faces many
obstacles. Of course, he also falls in love. The book will be published before the
end of this year. If you want to be one of its early reviewers, please fill
[this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1nW8lD1YsW4x78iy2LreZ-FVoyoD5s5_MydVH9LGJImA).

Once again let me ask you to review [my books](https://www.yegor256.com/books.html)
on Amazon in exchange for cactus
durable stickers. Those reviews really help me get new readers, I will appreciate if you post them.
Also, feel free to join my [Telegram group](https://t.me/joinchat/CLxAaUJFMRwu3ju_M3ec6A),
if you want to stay really tuned.

The [Webinar #28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYd24FN58wg) will
happen next week on Wednesday, the 4th of October.
We will go through a fully functional web app in Java,
and see what principles of object-oriented programming applied there.
We will review the source code of ThreeCopies.com.
