I hope you enjoy this summer, despite the weather. This is what
I would recommend you to read on my blog:

  * [How I Would Re-design equals()](https://www.yegor256.com/2017/07/11/how-to-redesign-equals.html)
    was about comparison of objects in OOP;
    I suggested an alternative approach to what Java was offering
    wtih `equals()` and `compareTo()`.

  * [Am I a Sexist?](https://www.yegor256.com/2017/07/04/sexism.html)
    and
    [The Bigger Victim of Sexual Harassment](https://www.yegor256.com/2017/07/18/sexual-harassment.html)
    were about gender proglems in our male-dominated engineering environment; they
    both triggered many comments, from haters and supporters;
    I'd be glad to hear your opinion too.

I made durable cactus stickers for your laptop or a mobile phone. I can
mail them to you in exchange for your honest five-stars Amazon review
of my book "Elegant Objects", either
[vol.1](https://amzn.to/2uRRubs) or
[vol.2](https://amzn.to/2vYxgNt).
Just post a review and email me the link to it together with your
postal address. The shipment is free of charge.

I recorded two new episodes of the Shift-M podcast.
[No.5](https://www.yegor256.com/shift-m/2017/5.html) about diversity and inclusive management (61 minutes)
and
[No.6](https://www.yegor256.com/shift-m/2017/6.html) with Susanne Madsen about leadership (49 minutes).
I'm sure they both are worth listening.

As usual, the [Webinar #27](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rEK3Rk2lX3M/mqdefault.jpg) will
happen tomorrow, on the 2nd of August.
We will go through the entire code base of [Cactoos](https://www.cactoos.org), polish it,
and release its next version to Maven Central.
Don't miss it at
