The summer is here! So is my regular newsletter. These articles
recently published definitely deserve your attention:

  * [Single Statement Unit Tests](https://www.yegor256.com/2017/05/17/single-statement-unit-tests.html)
    was an experimental proposal to make unit tests
    more object-oriented by prohibiting explicit algorithmic
    code inside them; I presented this idea
    at JEEConf a few days ago,
    [watch it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCr8hRE_TUs).

  * [Monikers Instead of Variables](https://www.yegor256.com/2017/05/16/monikers.html)
    suggested a programming language feature
    to make code more compact and cohesive, via
    inlined values (called "monikers") instead of traditional variables.

  * [A Remote Slave Is Still a Slave](https://www.yegor256.com/2017/05/02/remote-slaves.html)
    was a semi-sarcastic article about a very typical misunderstanding
    of software teams, which believed that just replacing
    cubicles with home offices makes them remote.
