Thanks to the Global Warming, the summer is finally here. This is what I wrote
in June:

  * [Object-Oriented Declarative Input/Output in Cactoos](https://www.yegor256.com/2017/06/22/object-oriented-input-output-in-cactoos.html)
    was a quick introduction to [Cactoos](https://www.cactoos.org) &mdash;
    the new Java framework, we've started to develop about a month ago, intending
    to offer an object-oriented alternative to Guava, Apache Commons,
    and the JDK itself; you most certainly should check out its
    [GitHub repo](https://github.com/yegor256/cactoos).

  * [Gluten-Free Management Recipes](https://www.yegor256.com/2017/06/06/gluten-free-management.html)
    was a sarcastic summary of how modern software development community
    saw a good project manager with a strong emphasis on things I
    disagreed with.

  * [My Work Environment](https://www.yegor256.com/2017/06/27/my-environment.html)
    was a detailed summary of the hardware and software I'm using
    in my day work; some people were interested to know so I published the list.

A few weeks ago I started to record [Shift-M](https://www.yegor256.com/shift-m.html),
my own podcast about project management. I've already recorded
four episodes, you can subscribe at
[iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/yegor256-podcast/id1150826721),
[SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/yegor256) or
[Android](http://subscribeonandroid.com/feeds.soundcloud.com/users/soundcloud:users:92341909/sounds.rss).
I'm planning to publish one episode per week and invite guests. All episodes
are recorded live &mdash; you can jump in and join the discussion. Just be in my
[Telegram group](https://t.me/joinchat/AAAAAEJFMRzsRTRxM3ec6A) and you
won't miss a thing.

As usual, the [Webinar #26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01OZ3SAM3s4) will
happen in two weeks, on the 12th of July, about debugging and unit testing,
don't miss it at
