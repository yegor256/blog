Those are the blog posts recently published, which are worth reading:

  * [Zerocracy: A Project Manager That Never Sleeps](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/03/21/zerocracy-announcement.html)
    is a long-awaited announcement of
    [Zerocracy](https://www.zerocracy.com),
    an idea I've been working on for the last eight years;
    now it's a hosted software product, which is already on the market (read below).

  * [Don't Aim for Quality, Aim for Speed](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/03/06/speed-vs-quality.html)
    claims that professional programmers must not focus
    on "doing the right thing," instead focusing on their speed of delivery,
    letting the project worry about quality.

  * [Fluent Interfaces Are Bad for Maintainability](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/03/13/fluent-interfaces.html)
    is a practical example of testing a Java class for thread-safety,
    using RunInThreads supplementary class from [Cactoos](https://www.cactoos.org).

We are launching the first version of [Zerocracy](https://www.zerocracy.com)
tomorrow. The product seems to be rather stable.
Over the last nine months of testing it has more or less successfully processed over 2000 tasks in
25 projects. Now it's time to let you use it in one of your projects.
We created a Telegram group for those who is interested to try it out,
