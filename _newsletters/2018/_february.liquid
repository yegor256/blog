The winter is over, hope you enjoyed it. Summer is coming.
This is what I managed to write during the last month:

  * [Don't Parse, Use Parsing Objects](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/02/27/parsing-objects.html)
    is about the subject I wanted to cover for over two years; it explains
    why deserialization is a bad idea if it's done via a DTO; the article
    suggest an alternative.

  * [Microvesting](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/02/13/micro-vesting.html)
    explains how programmers, in projects managed by
    [Zerocracy](https://www.zerocracy.com),
    earn equity on top of cash;
    this is done in micro increments, after each closed task.

  * [More Bugs, Please](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/02/06/where-to-find-more-bugs.html)
    is a quick cheat-sheet for programmers, suggesting many different
    sources of bugs in any software product.

[Zerocracy](https://www.zerocracy.com) is still in beta-testing mode,
with a pretty firm release date of April, 2. In the meantime, you can
[join](https://www.0crat.com/join) and play with it. It's a hosted automated
project manager, which makes software development truly distributed and logical.

Don't forget to join my
[Telegram chat](https://t.me/joinchat/AAAAAEJFMRzsRTRxM3ec6A) (490+ members at the moment),
to participate in daily discussions about OOP, management, Zerocracy, and
life.
