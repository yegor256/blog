Hope you enjoy this winter, despite the global warming and/or its absence.

As usual, here is a list of posts recently published on my blog:

  * [Five Stages of Microbudgeting](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/01/09/micro-budgeting.html)
    is a quick analysis of problems we faced over the last few years
    of doing microtasking; the problems related to payments and budgeting.

  * [Are You a Coder or a Developer?](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/01/23/sociotech-skills.html)
    is a true story of programmers joining
    [Zerocracy](https://www.zerocracy.com) now (we are still in beta-testing)
    and failing miserably, either due to our management mistakes or their
    lack of sociotech skills.

  * [Operator new() is Toxic](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/01/02/operator-new-is-toxic.html)
    is about the role of constructors in OOP and object
    instantiation in general, it's a follow-up for the Section 3.6 of
    [Elegant Objects Vol.1](https://amzn.to/2BJR1tv).

Even though [Zerocracy](https://www.zerocracy.com) (I founded it last year in order
to give everybody access to the proprietary [XDSD-insired](https://www.xdsd.org) management tools) is in testing mode now,
[over 50 programmers](https://www.0crat.com/gang) joined already.
You can join too. We pay $16/hour to those who work now in our
Ruby and Java "sandbox" projects. To try it out and make some money,
start [here](http://datum.zerocracy.com/pages/policy.html).
Please, be prepared for troubles and bugs, we are still testing and your
contribution will be very much appreciated.

Also, just ten days ago, we made Zerocracy [code base](https://github.com/zerocracy) fully open source. You
can contribute, either free or for cash+equity. That's right, we
give equity to our early contributors. If interested, ask me in this
[Telegram chat](https://t.me/joinchat/AAAAAEJFMRzsRTRxM3ec6A).
