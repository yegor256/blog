  JSON vs. XML? This comparison makes no sense, because
  the former is a simple data format while the latter is
  a language---a very powerful one.

JSON or XML? Which one is better? Which one is faster? Which
one should I use in my next project? Stop it! These things are not comparable.
It's similar to comparing a bicycle and an
[AMG S65](https://www.mbusa.com/mercedes/vehicles/model/class-S/model-S65V). Seriously,
which one is better? They both can take you from home to the office, right?
In some cases, a bicycle will do it better. But does that mean
they can be compared to each other? The same applies here with JSON and XML.
They are very different things with their own areas of applicability.

Here is how a simple JSON piece of data may look
(140 characters):

```json
{
  "id": 123,
  "title": "Object Thinking",
  "author": "David West",
  "published": {
    "by": "Microsoft Press",
    "year": 2004
  }
}
```

A similar document would look like this in XML
(167 characters):

```json
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<book id="123">
  <title>Object Thinking</title>
  <author>David West</author>
  <published>
    <by>Microsoft Press</by>
    <year>2004</year>
  </published>
</book>
```

{% quote JSON is a good data format, and it is just a data format %}

Looks easy to compare, right? The first example is a bit shorter,
is easier to understand since it's less "cryptic," and is also
perfectly parseable in JavaScript. That's it, then; let's use JSON
and manifest the death of XML! Who needs this heavyweight 15-year-old
XML in the first place?

Well, I need it, and I love it. Let me explain why.

And don't get me wrong; I'm not against JSON. Not at all.
It's a good **data format**. But it's just a data format.
We're using it **temporarily** to transfer a piece
of data from point A to point B. Indeed, it is shorter than XML and
more readable. That's it.

XML is not a data format; it is a **language**. A very powerful one. Let me
show you what it's capable of. Let me basically explain why I love it. And I would
strongly recommend you read
[**XML in a Nutshell, Third Edition**](https://amzn.to/2c5n8uC)
by Elliotte Rusty Harold and W. Scott Means.

I believe there are four features XML has that seriously set it apart from
JSON or any other simple data format, like
[YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) for example.

 * **XPath**.
  To get data like the year of publication from the document above, I just
  send an [XPath](https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath20/)
  query: `/book/published/year/text()`. However, there has to be
  an XPath processor that understands my request and returns `2004`.
  The beauty of this is that XPath [2.0](https://www.xml.com/pub/a/2002/03/20/xpath2.html)
  is a very powerful query engine
  with its own functions, predicates, axes, etc. You can literally put
  any logic into your XPath request without writing any traversing logic
  in Java, for example. You may ask "How many books were published by David West in 2004?"
  and get an answer, just via XPath. JSON is not even close to this.

 * **Attributes and Namespaces**.
  You can attach metadata to your data, just like it's done above
  with the `id` attribute. The data stays inside elements, just like the
  name of the book author, for example, while metadata (data about data)
  can and should be placed into attributes. This significantly helps in organizing
  and structuring information. On top of that, both elements and attributes
  can be marked as belonging to certain [namespaces](https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/).
  This is a very useful technique during times
  when a few applications are working with the same XML document.

 * **XML Schema**.
  When you create an XML document in one place, modify it a few times somewhere
  else, and then transfer it to yet another place, you want to make sure its
  structure is not broken by any of these actions. One of them may
  use `<year>` to store the publication date while another uses
  `<date>` with ISO-8601. To avoid that mess in structure, create a supplementary
  document, which is called [XML Schema](https://www.w3.org/XML/Schema),
  and ship it together with the main document.
  Everyone who wants to work with the main document will first **validate**
  its correctness using the schema supplied. This is a sort of integration testing
  in production. [RelaxNG](http://relaxng.org/)
  is a similar but simpler mechanism; give it a try if you find XML Schema too complex.

 * **XSL**.
  You can make modifications to your XML document without any Java/Ruby/etc. code
  at all. Just create an
  [XSL transformation](https://www.w3.org/TR/xslt20/) document and "apply" it to your
  original XML. As an output, you will get a new XML. The
  [XSL](https://www.w3.org/Style/XSL/) language
  (it is purely functional, by the way) is designed for hierarchical data
  manipulations. It is much more suitable for this task than Java or any other
  OOP/procedural approach. You can transform an XML document into anything, including
  plain text and
  [HTML]({% pst 2014/jun/2014-06-25-xml-and-xslt-in-browser %}).
  Some complain about XSL's complexity, but please
  give it a try. You won't need all of it, while its core functionality is
  pretty straight-forward.

This is not a full list, but these four features really mean a lot to me.
They give my document the ability to be "self-sufficient." It can validate
itself (XML Schema), it knows how to modify itself (XSL), and
it gives me very convenient access to anything inside it (XPath).

There are [many more](http://users.jyu.fi/~airi/xmlfamily.html)
languages, standards, and applications developed around XML, including
[XForms](https://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Forms/),
[SVG](https://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/),
[MathML](https://www.w3.org/Math/),
[RDF](https://www.w3.org/RDF/),
[OWL](https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/wiki/OWL),
[WSDL](https://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl), etc.
But you are less likely to use them
in a mainstream project, as they are rather "niche."

JSON was not designed to have such features, even though some of them
are now trying to find their places in the JSON world, including
[JSONPath](http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/) for querying,
[some tools](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1618038) for transformations, and
[json-schema](http://json-schema.org/) for validation. But they are just
weak parodies compared to what XML offers, and I don't think they have any future. Or
let's put it this way: I wish they would disappear sooner or later. They just
turn a good, simple format into something **clumsy**.

Thus, to conclude, JSON is a simple data format with no additional
functionality. Its best-use case is [AJAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29).
In all other cases, I strongly recommend you use XML.
