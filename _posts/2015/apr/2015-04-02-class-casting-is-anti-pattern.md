  Type casting and use of the instanceof operator, in particular,
  are terrible anti-patterns that diminish the entire idea
  of object-oriented programming.

Type casting is a very useful technique when there is no time
or desire to think and design objects properly. Type casting (or
class casting) helps us work with provided objects differently,
based on the class they belong to or the interface they implement. Class
casting helps us _discriminate_ against the poor objects and _segregate_
them by their race, gender, and religion. Can this be a good practice?

This is a very typical example of type casting (Google Guava is full
of it, for example
[`Iterables.size()`](https://github.com/google/guava/blob/v18.0/guava/src/com/google/common/collect/Iterables.java#L104-L111)):

```java
class Foo {
  int sizeOf(Iterable items) {
    int size = 0;
    if (items instanceof Collection) {
      size = Collection.class.cast(items).size();
    } else {
      for (Object item : items) {
        ++size;
      }
    }
    return size;
  }
}
```

This `sizeOf()`  method calculates the size of an iterable. However, it
is smart enough to understand that if `items` are also instances of `Collection`,
there is no need to actually iterate them. It would be much faster to
cast them to `Collection` and then call method `size()`. Looks logical,
but what's wrong with this approach? I see two practical problems.

First, there is a _hidden coupling_ of `sizeOf()` and `Collection`. This
coupling is not visible to the clients of `sizeOf()`. They don't know that
method `sizeOf()` relies on interface `Collection`. If tomorrow we decide
to change it, `sizeOf()` won't work. And we'll be very surprised, since
its signature says nothing about this dependency. This won't happen with
[`Collection`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Collection.html),
obviously, since it is part of the Java SDK, but with custom
classes, this may and will happen.

The second problem is an inevitably _growing complexity_ of the `sizeOf()` method. The
more special types it has to treat differently, the more complex it will become.
This `if/then` [forking]({% pst 2016/aug/2016-08-10-if-then-else-code-smell %})
is inevitable, since it has to check all possible
types and give them special treatment. Such complexity is a result
of a violation of the [single responsibility principle]({% pst 2017/dec/2017-12-19-srp-is-hoax %}). The method is not
only calculating the size of [`Iterable`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Iterable.html) but is also performing type
casting and forking based on that casting.

What is the alternative? There are a few, but the most obvious
is [method overloading]({% pst 2023/aug/2023-08-01-method-overloading %})
(not available in semi-OOP languages like Ruby or PHP):

```java
class Foo {
  int sizeOf(Iterable items) {
    int size = 0;
    for (Object item : items) {
      ++size;
    }
    return size;
  }
  int sizeOf(Collection items) {
    return items.size();
  }
}
```

Isn't that more elegant?

Philosophically speaking, type casting is discrimination  against the object
that comes into the method. The object complies with the contract provided by the
method signature. It implements the [`Iterable`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Iterable.html) interface, which
[is a contract]({% pst 2014/nov/2014-11-20-seven-virtues-of-good-object %}),
and it expects equal treatment with all other objects that come into
the same method. But the method discriminates objects by their types.
The method is basically asking the object about its... race. Black
objects go right while white objects go left. That's what this `instanceof`
is doing, and that's what discrimination is all about.

By using `instanceof`, the method is segregating incoming objects by the
certain group they belong to. In this case, there are two groups: collections
and everybody else. If you are a collection, you get special treatment.
Even though you abide by the `Iterable` contract, we still treat some objects
specially because they belong to an "elite" group called `Collection`.

You may say that `Collection` is just another contract that an object may
comply with. That's true, but in this case, there should be another door through
which those who work by that contract should enter. You announced that
`sizeOf()` accepts everybody who works on the `Iterable` contract. I am an object,
and I do what the contract says. I enter the method and expect
equal treatment with everybody else who comes into the same method.
But, apparently, once inside the method, I realize that some objects have
some special privileges. Isn't that discrimination?

To conclude, I would consider `instanceof` and class casting to be
anti-patterns and code smells. Once you see a need to use them,
start thinking about refactoring.
