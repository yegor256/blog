Rules:

  * One person can submit **only one** project.

  * Submissions are accepted until the **September 1, 2016**.

  * I will check the commit history to make sure you're the main contributor to the project.

  * I reserve the right to reject any submission without explanation.

  * All submissions will be published on this page (including rejected ones).

  * Results will be announced **October 15, 2016** on this page and by email.

  * The best project will receive **$4,096**.

  * Final decisions will be made by me and are not negotiable
    (although I may invite other people to help me make the right decision).

  * Winners that received any cash prizes in previous years can't submit again.

Each project must be:

  * Open source (in GitHub).

  * At least 10,000 lines of code.

  * At least one year old.

  * Object-oriented (that's the only thing I understand).

The best project is selected using this [criteria]({% pst 2015/jun/2015-06-08-deadly-sins-software-project %}).

What doesn't matter:

  * Popularity. Even if nobody is using your
    product, it is still eligible for this award. I don't care about
    popularity; quality is the key.

  * Programming language. I believe that any language, used correctly,
    can be applied to design a high-quality product.

  * Buzz and trends. Even if your project is yet another parser of command
    line arguments, it's still eligible for the award. I don't care about
    your marketing position; quality is all.

By the way, if you want to sponsor this award and increase the bonus,
[email me](mailto:me@yegor256.com).

15 Oct 2016:
I asked one of our Java developers to do a preliminary analysis
of all projects. This is the report he sent me back today:
[`award-2015.txt`](/txt/2015/award-2015.txt) (you can find your project there).
I added my comments to his pluses and minuses (see them right in that text file).
Based on his opinion and a preliminary analysis I picked these few finalists:

 * `pholser/junit-quickcheck` (Java)
 * `NullVoxPopuli/aeonvera` (Ruby)
 * `SimonKagstrom/kcov` (C++)
 * `skinny-framework/skinny-framework` (Scala)
 * `paypal/squbs` (Scala)
 * `ben-manes/caffeine` (Java)
 * `coala/coala` (Python)

I'm sorry for being late, but I need a few more days to analyze them properly
and decide which one gets the prize. I will announce the winner on 21st of October,
in six days. I will email everybody and publish my decision here.
