A bug exists when something doesn't work as expected. A _bug
fix_ is basically a patch (a pull request) to the existing code base that
is supposed to solve the problem and make sure that "something"
works as expected. Very often, such a patch fixes one thing
and breaks many others. I believe that sometimes it's necessary to _reject_
a bug fix and ask its author to re-do the patch in order to
protect the project from bigger problems. There are a few
valid reasons for such a rejection, according to my experience.

## It Degrades Code Coverage

This is a very common situation: After the changes are made in one place,
unit tests fail in some other place. The bug is fixed, but some possibly
unrelated unit tests start to report failure. Under pressure or simply because
we're lazy, we don't fix them; we simply remove the tests or mark them
as temporarily "skipped." The problem is solved, the build is clean, so let's
merge the patch and call it a day, right? Wrong!

Even though I'm in favor of [cutting corners]({% pst 2015/jan/2015-01-15-how-to-cut-corners %})
as much as possible, this is the corner I don't recommend you cut.

The unit tests are there precisely to prevent us from breaking the
product when under pressure.

Obviously, there are situations when the unit tests are wrong and
we have to delete them. In those cases, don't forget to create new ones.

There are also situations when the bug must be fixed in a few minutes
to put the system back online and fixing all unit tests will take an hour.
Such a situation is a strong indicator that you've got a terrible underlying
situation with test coverage in the product. There's no doubt that we have to make
a fix and ask our tests to shut up for some time. But in this case, make sure
the next task your team is working on after the bug fix is released is
correcting those disabled unit tests. I would recommend reading
[Working Effectively With Legacy Code](https://amzn.to/1SdcZ8M)
by Michael Feathers, which tackles this very subject.

## It Doesn't Reproduce the Issue

Sometimes the entire system may be down simply because of a small
typo in one line of code. An obvious bug fix is to remove the typo, but
that's not what a good project is expecting from us if we care about its
quality. The problem is not the typo but rather the absence of unit tests
that would catch the typo at the deployment phase.

{% quote The problem is not the typo but rather the absence of unit tests that would catch the typo at the deployment phase %}

The real problem is the lack of test code coverage in this particular
section of the code. By removing the typo, we're not helping the project
in any way. Moreover, we're doing it a disservice---we're _concealing_
the real problem.

Thus, no matter how small or cosmetic the issue is, its bug fix
must contain an extra test that first reproduces the bug. Without such
a test, a bug fix is a waste of the project's money.

Furthermore, without a unit test reproducing the issue, there is no
guarantee that our bug fix doesn't introduce more bugs. I would even say that
the more bug fixes we have, the higher the
[entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_%28information_theory%29).
And the only way to decrease this uncertainty is by covering the
code with unit tests. Without a test, a bug fix brings more disorder
to the code base.

## It Is Too Big

Bug fixes are _not features_; they must be small and focused. It's a very
typical mistake for programmers to get carried away while fixing a
bug and introduce some refactoring together with a fix. The result is that the
patch gets rather big and difficult to understand. I'm not against refactoring; it's
a very important and positive thing for a project, but do it separately
_after_ the bug is fixed and merged.

No refactoring while fixing a bug!

Create a new unit test, reproduce the bug, and commit it. Fix the bug
in the existing code base, no matter how ugly it is. Create new
bugs, asking the team to improve the situation with the ugly code base.
If interested, assign those bugs to yourself. Or maybe somebody else
will be interested in fixing them and refactoring the code. But all that
will happen later in other pull requests with new
[code reviews]({% pst 2015/feb/2015-02-09-serious-code-reviewer %})
and new merges.

It's not about being [lazy]({% pst 2018/apr/2018-04-17-how-to-be-lazy %})
and unwilling to fix what looks bad. It's about
a discipline, which is [much more important]({% pst 2015/jan/2015-01-15-how-to-cut-corners %})
than good intentions.

## It Solves More Than One Issue

Always fix one issue at a time---simple as that. No exceptions. When
a bug fix patch contains code changes that fix multiple issues, it is
very difficult to understand which issue is tested, which one is reproduced,
and how they relate to each other. Combining several bug fixes into a single
pull request is a very bad practice.

No matter how simple the fix is, keep it separate from others.
Review, test, and merge it individually. This will also increase the
traceability of changes. It will always be easy to understand who made
that fix, who reviewed the code, and when it was merged (and deployed).
