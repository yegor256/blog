Here is [**the form**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1mf0IGryvAhUnIbbhemXPSbIXxE21e190MyQdKuEY_zw)
to fill out.

This year we do this competition together with
[KaiCode](https://www.kaicode.org), which is an open source
initiative to support young and emerging products. We hope
that some of our winners will get rewards from KaiCode.

Rules:

  * One person can submit only one project.

  * Submissions are accepted until ~~September~~ October 1, 2021.

  * I will check the commit history to make sure you're the main contributor to the project.

  * I reserve the right to reject any submission without explanation.

  * All submissions will be published on this page (including rejected ones).

  * Results will be announced ~~October~~ November 15, 2021 on this page and by email (or maybe a bit later).

  * The best project will receive $4,096
    (I may split this amount among a few projects and may give away a smaller amount!).

  * Final decisions will be made by me and are not negotiable
    (although I may invite other people to help me make the right decision).

  * Winners that received any cash prizes in previous years can't submit again.

Each project must be:

  * Open source (in GitHub).

  * At least 4,096 lines of code ([`cloc`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cloc) without any arguments)
    _and_ at least 16,384 [hits-of-code]({% pst 2014/nov/2014-11-14-hits-of-code %}).

  * At least one year old (the age of the first commit).

  * Object-oriented (that's the only thing I understand).

The best project is selected using this [criteria]({% pst 2015/jun/2015-06-08-deadly-sins-software-project %}).

What doesn't matter:

  * Popularity. Even if nobody is using your
    product, it is still eligible for this award. I don't care about
    popularity; quality is the key.

  * Programming language. I believe that any language, used correctly,
    can be applied to design a high-quality product.

  * Buzz and trends. Even if your project is yet another parser of command
    line arguments, it's still eligible for the award. I don't care about
    your marketing position; quality is all.

By the way, if you want to sponsor this award and increase the bonus,
