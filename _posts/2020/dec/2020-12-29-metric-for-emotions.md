  No matter how big your contribution to a project is,
  your performance will be judged emotionally,
  especially in self-managing orgs.

You got into a company that believes in
[democratic]({% pst 2015/oct/2015-10-13-competition-without-rules %})
values, doesn't [measure]({% pst 2020/jun/2020-06-23-individual-performance-metrics %})
performance, doesn't judge, doesn't
[control]({% pst 2016/sep/2016-09-27-command-control-innovate %}), doesn't force, and
doesn't blame; however, at the end of the year they tell you that
your performance was not as high as expected. Why?
"Just work better, my friend, we count on you!"
Bad luck, you are in a teal [self-managing organization]({% pst 2020/dec/2020-12-22-self-managing-orgs %}). 
They've already
killed the management, but still didn't dare to kill the managers.
They don't know how to measure, but still have people who are
supposed to do it regularly, in order to distribute monetary rewards.
What do you do before you quit? Here is a survival recipe.

Here are the symptoms of a disease known as
"[self-managing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workers'_self-management)"
organizations (also known as teal orgs, or no-management orgs, or
[democratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_style#Democratic)
management, or humane management, or just love and peace):

  * You do have managers. They decide when you get a salary raise,
    when you are promoted, when fired, when moved to a new project,
    and so on. They do exist.

  * They tell you that they are _not_ managers, but partners,
    co-founders, friends, or even family members.

  * They meet you time to time for face-to-face talks
    to focus you on big objectives and inject some
    [guilt]({% pst 2019/sep/2019-09-03-injection-of-guilt %}):
    "We must focus on our customers, or our business value, on strategic
    growth! We must make a big impact! We count on your great results
    this year!"

  * They don't give you any numeric evaluation of your performance
    during the course of the entire year.
    Unfortunately, there are simply no metrics, mostly because it's a very bad idea
    to put a number on a person! When and if you try to suggest some metrics,
    everybody laughs and says that "It's very difficult to measure
    the performance of creative people! <del>Go back to your cage!</del>"

  * When the time comes, they make their monetary decisions based on their personal
    emotional and irrational judgment of yourself and your results.
    You just get a smaller bonus by the end of the year than Jeff, your
    less experienced but more vocal and friendly co-worker.
    Why? Just because. Take it or leave it.

  * If you get brave enough and ask them why your bonus is smaller
    than Jeff's, they ask you "How do you know??"
    and start investigating. Then, when they
    calm down, you get a long lecture, mentioning some year-old
    facts about you not attending the office on that Saturday
    "you definitely remember" when everybody was fixing the production
    server previously broken by Jeff.

  * Finally, you quit.

Hold on, don't quit. In almost all other organizations you will
meet the same idiots, but with different names. They are not evil people,
they are just incompetent. They never studied project management, they
don't have any professional education, they only read books like
[Reinventing Organizations](https://amzn.to/3mgxt7k) and listen
to lectures on leadership and multiculturalism. They are not managers.
Forgive them.

But the question remains, how to behave in order to get the biggest
bonus by the end of the year. I would even say that a more important question
is how to not get yourself hugely frustrated when your bonus is smaller
than Jeff's, who was obviously less productive, according to your personal
judgment. This actually is the key problem: jealousy. If you see
that someone, who you don't respect due to his/her bad results and lack
of skills, is appreciated more than yourself by your boss ---
you get jealous and quit.

{% quote When they can't objectively evaluate your performance, they judge you irrationally and emotionally. %}

Teal [gluten-free]({% pst 2017/jun/2017-06-06-gluten-free-management %})
managers can't objectively evaluate your performance.
They will always judge you irrationally and emotionally. They simply
don't collect any data during the year (because it's a bad idea,
[remember]({% pst 2020/jun/2020-06-23-individual-performance-metrics %})!)
and the only thing they have in front of them when it's time to make
a decision---is their feelings about yourself!

I think that it's still possible to survive in this
[mess]({% pst 2020/jan/2020-01-07-embrace-the-chaos %}) though. We just
have to understand how their minds work.
Is it possible to continue doing what we are doing, while
giving these managers something they can use as performance data at the
end of the year? I believe, we have one good metric, they subconsciously
rely on, which we can more or less easily increase:

"The _amount of messages_ you get from your boss per day."

If you want to be the best in the team, no matter what are your
factual results, boost this metric. It's simple. Just stay in touch
with the bosses: send them updates, ask questions, share news, go
to lunch with them, rat on your colleagues, spread rumors, etc.
No matter what you do, the goal is: increase the number of messages
they send you back. If it's growing, you are getting closer to them,
they pay attention to you, they start feeling that you are important,
they will appraise you positively when the time comes. If the number
decreases, you are getting out of their circle---it's dangerous.

This metric will help you understand your position in the team before
the end of the year, when it would be too late. Just see how often the boss
is texting Jeff and you will know where you stand. No matter
what Jeff is working on, what the quality of his code is, what the
value of his contribution is---these things are less important than the
traffic of messages your mutual boss is sending to him.

Am I being too sarcastic? Not really. This is the new reality
the proponents of self-managing teams are pushing us towards:
Objectivity and honesty is being replaced with adulation and grovelling.
Take it or leave it.
