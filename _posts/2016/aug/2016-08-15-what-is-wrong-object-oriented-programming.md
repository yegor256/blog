Recently, I was trying to convince a few of my readers that
[a better understanding of an object]({% pst 2016/jul/2016-07-14-who-is-object %})
in OOP would help us solve many problems in existing pseudo-object-oriented languages.
Then, suddenly, the question came up: "_What problems?_"
I was puzzled. I thought it was obvious that the vast majority of modern software
written in modern OO languages is unmaintainable and simply a mess.
So I Googled a bit, and this is what I found (in chronological order).

by accretion. What this often means, in practice, is that it
provides a structured way to write spaghetti code."

systems, graphical user interfaces, and certain kinds of simulation.
To the surprise and gradual disillusionment of many, it has proven
difficult to demonstrate significant benefits of OO outside those areas."

"C++ is a horrible language. ...
C++ leads to really, really bad design choices. ...
In other words, the only way to do good, efficient, and system-level and
portable C++ ends up to limit yourself to all the things that are
basically available in C. And limiting your project to C means that people
don't screw that up, and also means that you get a lot of programmers that
do actually understand low-level issues and don't screw things up with any
idiotic "object model" crap."

"OOP is about taming complexity through modeling, but we have not
mastered this yet, possibly because we have difficulty distinguishing
real and accidental complexity."

"I think that large objected-oriented programs struggle
with increasing complexity as you build this large object graph of
mutable objects. You know, trying to understand and keep in your mind
what will happen when you call a method and what will the side effects be."

"I used to be enamored of object-oriented programming. I'm now finding myself
leaning toward believing that it is a plot designed to destroy joy. The
methodology looks clean and elegant at first, but when you actually get
into real programs they rapidly turn into horrid messes."

"Object-oriented programming, whose essence is nothing more than
programming using data with associated behaviors, is a powerful idea.
It truly is. But it's not always the best idea. ...
Sometimes data is just data and functions are just functions."

this idea has failed us, and we must give up on it."

call the one function that you modified."
