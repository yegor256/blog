  Equity or cash? These days, it seems that working for
  equity is the way to become a millionaire.
  I don't think it's true.

"You're a good programmer. I'm a great entrepreneur. This is a
breakthrough idea. Help me build it. I don't have cash, but I will
give you equity. Deal?" I hear this at least once a month, and
I always say no. Not because I don't like your idea. Indeed, it
is really interesting. And not because I'm too busy. I would
definitely find time for a good idea. It's not that. I say no because
I don't think you're a good entrepreneur.

So you want a good programmer to build your product. Or maybe a group
of good programmers. And you are ready to give me some equity
in exchange. That's reasonable.

{% quote You're a good entrepreneur, right? How come you don't have money, then? %}

But what is your part of the deal?

How much are you putting on the table?

You say that you're a good entrepreneur, right? How come
you don't have money, then? How come you can't find someone to pay
for the work of a good programmer?

I will create a product for you, but you will most certainly
fail. You _already_ failed. You failed to find initial
investment to cover the startup expenses of the business.
Why do you think you will succeed after the product is ready?

The point is that a good programmer will _never_
work for equity. Not because a good programmer is greedy,
or doesn't want to risk, or doesn't believe
in new ideas. Not at all.

A good programmer wants to work with a _good_ entrepreneur. And
a good entrepreneur knows how to find money. That's the definition
of a decent entrepreneur.

Period.
