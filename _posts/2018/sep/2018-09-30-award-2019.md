This is the fifth year of the
[Software Quality Award](/award.html). The prize
is still the same---**$4,096**.
The rules are still the same. Read on.
Previous years are here:
[2015]({% pst 2015/apr/2015-04-16-award %}),
[2016]({% pst 2015/oct/2015-10-17-award-2016 %}),
[2017]({% pst 2016/oct/2016-10-23-award-2017 %}),
[2018]({% pst 2017/oct/2017-10-24-award-2018 %}).

Rules:

  * One person can submit only one project.

  * Submissions are accepted until September 1, 2019.

  * I will check the commit history to make sure you're the main contributor to the project.

  * I reserve the right to reject any submission without explanation.

  * All submissions will be published on this page (including rejected ones).

  * Results will be announced October 15, 2019 on this page and by email.

  * The best project will receive $4,096
    (I may split this amount among a few projects and may give away a smaller amount!).

  * Final decisions will be made by me and are not negotiable
    (although I may invite other people to help me make the right decision).

  * Winners that received any cash prizes in previous years can't submit again.

Each project must be:

  * Open source (in GitHub).

  * At least 4,096 lines of code ([`cloc`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cloc) without any arguments)
    _and_ at least 16,384 [hits-of-code]({% pst 2014/nov/2014-11-14-hits-of-code %}).

  * At least one year old.

  * Object-oriented (that's the only thing I understand).

The best project is selected using this [criteria]({% pst 2015/jun/2015-06-08-deadly-sins-software-project %}).

What doesn't matter:

  * Popularity. Even if nobody is using your
    product, it is still eligible for this award. I don't care about
    popularity; quality is the key.

  * Programming language. I believe that any language, used correctly,
    can be applied to design a high-quality product.

  * Buzz and trends. Even if your project is yet another parser of command
    line arguments, it's still eligible for the award. I don't care about
    your marketing position; quality is all.

By the way, if you want to sponsor this award and increase the bonus,

A few Java projects were reviewed by [@driver733](https://github.com/driver733). Others
I've reviewed myself (which was a very time consuming job, but I enjoyed it).

You can read all reviews in [this text file](/txt/2019/award-2019.txt). The decision
is obvious this year. There are two projects, which are pretty good:
[`fabriciofx/cactoos-jdbc`](https://github.com/fabriciofx/cactoos-jdbc) and
[`proshin-roman/finapi-java-client`](https://github.com/proshin-roman/finapi-java-client).
They both are pretty small, but big enough to satisfy the competition requirements.
Each of them gets $1,024 this year. This time I'm not going to send them
the money directly, but will just fund their Zerocracy projects. They will
be able to pay themselves or other programmers there.
