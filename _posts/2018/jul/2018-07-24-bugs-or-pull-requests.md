Here is how it goes, over and over again. I find a new developer for one of
my projects managed by Zerocracy. He claims to be an expert with 10 years
of hands-on coding experience, $60 hourly rate (we [don't hire]({% pst 2014/oct/2014-10-29-how-much-do-you-cost %}) US guys),
and fluent English. Then he joins the project and attempts
to close a few tickets. But he hardly can. For many reasons. Then he comes back
and explains why [our microtasking methodology]({% pst 2017/nov/2017-11-28-microtasking %})
doesn't work, trying to convince me
that I have to pay him [per hour]({% pst 2015/jul/2015-07-21-hourly-pay-modern-slavery %}),
instead of per result. Here is my answer.

No matter how bad the methodology is, you do know that [we pay]({% pst 2014/apr/2014-04-13-bugs-are-welcome %})
for each bug that is found and properly reported, right?
Check [§29](https://www.zerocracy.com/policy.html#29) of our Policy.

If the Code Base Is Bad, Why Don't You Report Bugs?

If the Code Base Is Good, Where Are Your Pull Requests?

{% youtube _ppWQCCT8zE %}

There is only one metric on our projects, which separates good programmers
from bad ones: the amount of money they are making.
You can make money contributing to the project either by
1) reporting bugs (when you see problems)
or 2) submitting pull requests (when you don't see problems).

If none of that works for you, you are a bad programmer.

Good bye.
