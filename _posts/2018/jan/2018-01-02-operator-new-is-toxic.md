  Instantiating objects via operator NEW is what we

  important where this happens.

To instantiate objects, in most object-oriented languages,
including Java, Ruby, and C++, we use operator `new()`. Well, unless
we use static factory methods, which we don't use because
[they are evil]({% pst 2017/nov/2017-11-14-static-factory-methods %}).
Even though it looks so easy to make a new object any time we need it,
I would recommend to be more careful with this rather toxic operator.

I'm sure you understand that the problem with this operator is that
it couples objects, making testing and reuse very difficult or even impossible.
Let's say there is a story in a file that we need to read as a UTF-8 text
(I'm using
[`TextOf`](http://static.javadoc.io/org.cactoos/cactoos/0.25.6/org/cactoos/text/TextOf.html)
from [Cactoos](https://www.cactoos.org)):

```java
class Story {
  String text() {
    return new TextOf(
      new File("/tmp/story.txt")
    ).asString();
  }
}
```

It seems super simple, but the problem is obvious: class `Story` can't
be reused. It can only read one particular file. Moreover, testing it
will be rather difficult, since it reads the content from exactly one place,
which can't be changed at all. More formally this problem is known as an
_unbreakable dependency_---we can't break the link between `Story`
and `/tmp/story.txt`---they are together forever.

To solve this we need to introduce a constructor and let `Story` accept
the location of the content as an argument:

```java
class Story {
  private final File file;
  Story(File f) {
    this.file = f;
  }
  String text() {
    return new TextOf(this.file).asString();
  }
}
```

Now, each user of the `Story` has to know the name of the file:

```java
new Story(new File("/tmp/story.txt"));
```

It's not really
convenient, especially for those users who were using `Story` before, knowing
nothing about the file path. To help them we introduce
a [secondary constructor]({% pst 2015/may/2015-05-28-one-primary-constructor %}):

```java
class Story {
  private final File file;
  Story() { // Here!
    this(new File("/tmp/story.txt"));
  }
  Story(File f) {
    this.file = f;
  }
  String text() {
    return new TextOf(this.file).asString();
  }
}
```

Now we just make an instance through a no-arguments constructor, just like
we did before:

```java
new Story();
```

I'm sure you're well aware of this technique, which is also known
as [dependency injection](https://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html).
I'm actually not saying anything new. What I want you to pay attention to here is
the location and the amount of `new` operators in all three code snippets.

In the first snippet both `new` operators are in the method `text()`.
In the second snippet we lost one of them. In the third snippet one operator
is in the method, while the second one moved up, to the constructor.

Remember this fact and let's move on.

What if the file is not in UTF-8 encoding but in [KOI8-R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KOI8-R)?
Class `TextOf` and then method `Story.text()` will throw an exception.
However, class `TextOf` is capable of reading in any encoding, it just
needs to have a secondary argument for its constructor:

```java
new TextOf(this.file, "KOI8_R").asString();
```

In order to make `Story` capable of using different encodings, we need to
introduce a few additional secondary constructors and modify its primary
constructor:

```java
class Story {
  private final Text text;
  Story() {
    this(new File("/tmp/story.txt"));
  }
  Story(File f) {
    this(f, StandardEncodings.UTF_8);
  }
  Story(File f, Encoding e) {
    this(new TextOf(f, e));
  }
  Story(Text t) {
    this.text = t;
  }
  String text() {
    return this.text.asString();
  }
}
```

It's just dependency injection, but pay attention to the locations
of the operator `new`. They are all in the
constructors now and none of them are left in the method `text()`.

The tendency here is obvious to me: the more the `new` operators stay in the
methods, the less reusable and testable is the class.

In other words, operator `new` is a rather toxic thing, so try to keep its
usage to a minimum in your methods. Make sure you instantiate everything
or almost everything in your secondary constructors.
