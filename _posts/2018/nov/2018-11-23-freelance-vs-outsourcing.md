The outsourcing in combination with low-cost offshoring was a major trend in the
software industry twenty years ago. Since then small groups of enthusiasts grew
into large companies with thousands of employees and dozens of offices all over
the world, like Wipro, EPAM, Luxoft, and others. Despite the
obvious success, the future of software development may need a different
business model, since clients' requirements are rapidly changing. The market is
quickly shifting towards more flexible work models, which compete with full-time
office employment and time&material contracts.

The umbrella term for this new
trend is "freelance." The [recent IPO of Upwork](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/03/upwork-ceo-on-ipo-day-we-do-not-incentivize-for-less-pay-for-freelancers.html),
with a valuation of over $1.5B, demonstrates that the demand is high and will only grow. There is a lot of space
for it, since Upwork only works with just 400,000 freelancers, while the entire
population of programmers is [over 20 million](https://evansdata.com/reports/viewRelease.php?reportID=9).

In order to survive, smart software houses must realize that the future, in its 10-15 years horizon, will
make it mandatory for software projects to work with freelancers or build teams
entirely of people working remotely and part-time. Gallup recently
[found out](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/30/70-percent-of-people-globally-work-remotely-at-least-once-a-week-iwg-study.html)
that the number of American employees working remotely rose to 43 percent in
2016 from 39 percent in 2012.

This growing army of telecommuters will need
completely new methods of management, which have to be developed, tested, and
yet prove their effectiveness. Traditional co-located teams, which are the core
element of any large outsourcing company, may find it difficult or even
impossible to invent them. This may become a major problem for large outsources,
unless they adapt to the rapidly changing market landscape.

The founding team of [Zerocracy](https://www.zerocracy.com) has spent over eight years to understand
this new emerging world of freelance, investigate its [laws and rules](https://www.yegor256.com/2016/08/05/distributed-teams-are-higher-quality.html),
and invent [instruments](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/03/21/zerocracy-announcement.html)
to make distributed projects even more successful than
co-located ones. For a smart software house Zerocracy is an ideal transition
to the new territory, without losing time of their projects and the quality
of their products.
