After a few recent posts about immutability, including
[Objects Should Be Immutable]({% pst 2014/jun/2014-06-09-objects-should-be-immutable %}) and
[How an Immutable Object Can Have State and Behavior?]({% pst 2014/dec/2014-12-09-immutable-object-state-and-behavior %}),
I was surprised by the number of comments saying that I badly misunderstood
the idea. Most of those comments stated that an immutable object must always behave
the same way---that is what immutability is about. What kind of immutability
is it, if a method returns different results each time we call it?
This is not how well-known immutable classes behave. Take, for example, `String`, `BigInteger`,
`Locale`, `URI`, `URL`, `Inet4Address`, `UUID`, or wrapper classes for primitives, like `Double` and
`Integer`. Other comments argued against
[the very definition]({% pst 2014/nov/2014-11-20-seven-virtues-of-good-object %})
of an immutable object as a representative of a mutable real-world entity. How
could an immutable object represent a mutable entity? Huh?

I'm very surprised. This post is going to clarify the definition of an immutable
[object]({% pst 2016/jul/2016-07-14-who-is-object %}).
First, here is a quick answer. How can an immutable object represent a mutable entity?
Look at an immutable class,
[`File`](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/File.html),
and its methods, for example `length()` and `delete()`. The class is immutable, according
to Oracle documentation, and its methods may return different values each time
we call them. An object of class `File`, being perfectly immutable,
represents a mutable real-world entity, a file on disk.

In [this post]({% pst 2014/jun/2014-06-09-objects-should-be-immutable %}), I said
that "an object is immutable if its state can't be modified after it is created."
This definition is not mine; it's taken from
[Java Concurrency in Practice by Goetz et al.](https://amzn.to/2c7sVS1), Section 3.4
(by the way, I highly recommend you read it). Now look at this class
(I'm using [jcabi-http](https://http.jcabi.com) to read and write over HTTP):

```java
@Immutable
class Page {
  private final URI uri;
  Page(URI addr) {
    this.uri = addr;
  }
  public String load() {
    return new JdkRequest(this.uri)
      .fetch().body();
  }
  public void save(String content) {
    new JdkRequest(this.uri)
      .method("PUT")
      .body().set(content).back()
      .fetch();
  }
}
```

What is the "state" in this class? That's right, `this.uri` is the state. It
uniquely identifies every object of this class, and it is not modifiable. Thus,
the class makes only immutable objects. And each object represents a
mutable entity of the real world, a web page with a URI.

There is no contradiction in this situation. The class is perfectly immutable,
while the web page it represents is mutable.

{% youtube KwP7Ay9Z-hc %}

Why do most programmers I have talked to believe that
if an underlying entity is mutable, an object is mutable too? I think the
answer is simple---they think that objects are
data structures with methods. That's why, from this point of view,
an immutable object is a data structure that never changes.

This is where the fallacy is coming from---an object is
**not a data structure**. It is a living organism representing
a real-world entity inside the object's living environment (a computer program).
It does encapsulate some data, which helps to locate the entity in the real world. The encapsulated
data is the **coordinates** of the entity being represented. In the case
of `String` or `URL`, the coordinates are the same as the
entity itself, but this is just an isolated incident, not a generic rule.

{% youtube EnhRgXrHCC4 %}

An immutable object is not a data structure that doesn't change, even
though `String`, `BigInteger`, and `URL` look like one. An object is immutable
if and only if it doesn't change the coordinates of the real-world entity
it represents. In the `Page` class above, this means that an object of
the class, once instantiated, will never change `this.uri`. It will
always point to the same web page, no matter what.

And the object doesn't guarantee anything about the behavior of that web page. The page
is a dynamic creature of a real world, living its own life. Our object
can't promise anything about the page. The only thing it promises is that
it will always stay loyal to that page---it will never forget or change
its coordinates.

Conceptually speaking, immutability means loyalty, that's all.
