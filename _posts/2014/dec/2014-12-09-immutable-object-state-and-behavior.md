I often hear this argument against
[immutable objects]({% pst 2014/jun/2014-06-09-objects-should-be-immutable %}):
"Yes, they are useful when the state doesn't change. However, in
our case, we deal with frequently changing objects. We simply
can't afford to create a new `document` every time we just
need to change its `title`." Here is where I disagree: object
title is **not a state** of a document, if you need to change it frequently.
Instead, it is a document's **behavior**. A `document` can and must be
[immutable]({% pst 2016/sep/2016-09-07-gradients-of-immutability %}),
if it is a [good object]({% pst 2014/nov/2014-11-20-seven-virtues-of-good-object %}),
even when its title is changed frequently. Let me explain how.

## Identity, State, and Behavior

Basically, there are three elements in every
[object]({% pst 2016/jul/2016-07-14-who-is-object %}):
identity, state, and behavior. *Identity* is what distinguishes our `document`
from other objects, *state* is what a document
knows about itself (a.k.a. "encapsulated knowledge"), and
*behavior* is what a document can do for us on request.
For example, this is a mutable document:

```java
class Document {
  private int id;
  private String title;
  Document(int id) {
    this.id = id;
  }
  public String getTitle() {
    return this.title;
  }
  public String setTitle(String text) {
    this.title = text;
  }
  @Override
  public String toString() {
    return String.format("doc #%d about '%s'", this.id, this.text);
  }
}
```

Let's try to use this mutable object:

```java
Document first = new Document(50);
first.setTitle("How to grill a sandwich");
Document second = new Document(50);
second.setTitle("How to grill a sandwich");
if (first.equals(second)) { // FALSE
  System.out.println(
    String.format("%s is equal to %s", first, second)
  );
}
```

Here, we're creating two objects and then modifying their encapsulated
states. Obviously, `first.equals(second)` will return `false` because
the two objects have different identities, even though they encapsulate the
same state.

{% youtube KwP7Ay9Z-hc %}

Method `toString()` exposes the document's behavior---the document can
convert itself to a string.

In order to modify a document's title, we just call its `setTitle()`
once again:

```java
first.setTitle("How to cook pasta");
```

Simply put, we can reuse the object many times, modifying its
internal state. It is fast and convenient, isn't it? Fast, yes.
Convenient, not really. Read on.

## Immutable Objects Have No Identity

As I've [mentioned before]({% pst 2014/nov/2014-11-20-seven-virtues-of-good-object %}),
immutability is one of the virtues of a good
object, and a very important one. A good object is immutable, and good
software contains only immutable objects. The main difference between
immutable and mutable objects is that
an immutable one doesn't have an identity and its state never changes.
Here is an immutable variant of the same document:

```java
@Immutable
class Document {
  private final int id;
  private final String title;
  Document(int id, String text) {
    this.id = id;
    this.title = text;
  }
  public String title() {
    return this.title;
  }
  public Document title(String text) {
    return new Document(this.id, text);
  }
  @Override
  public boolean equals(Object doc) {
    return doc instanceof Document
      && Document.class.cast(doc).id == this.id
      && Document.class.cast(doc).title.equals(this.title);
  }
  @Override
  public String toString() {
    return String.format(
      "doc #%d about '%s'", this.id, this.text
    );
  }
}
```

This document is immutable, and its state (`id` ad `title`) is its identity. Let's
see how we can use this immutable class
(by the way, I'm using [`@Immutable`](https://aspects.jcabi.com/annotation-immutable.html) annotation
from [jcabi-aspects](https://aspects.jcabi.com)):

```java
Document first = new Document(50, "How to grill a sandwich");
Document second = new Document(50, "How to grill a sandwich");
if (first.equals(second)) { // TRUE
  System.out.println(
    String.format("%s is equal to %s", first, second)
  );
}
```

We can't modify a document any more. When we need to change the title,
we have to create a new document:

```java
Document first = new Document(50, "How to grill a sandwich");
first = first.title("How to cook pasta");
```

Every time we want to modify its encapsulated state, we have to modify
its identity too, because there is no identity. State is the identity.
Look at the code of the `equals()` method above---it compares documents
by their IDs and titles. Now ID+title of a document is its identity!

## What About Frequent Changes?

Now I'm getting to the question we started with: What about performance
and convenience? We don't want to change the entire document every time we
have to modify its title. If the document is big enough, that would be
a huge obligation. Moreover, if an immutable object encapsulates other immutable
objects, we have to change the entire hierarchy when modifying even a single
string in one of them.

{% youtube EnhRgXrHCC4 %}

The answer is simple. A document's title should not be part of its **state**.
Instead, the title should be its **behavior**. For example, consider this:

```java
@Immutable
class Document {
  private final int id;
  Document(int id) {
    this.id = id;
  }
  public String title() {
    // read title from storage
  }
  public void title(String text) {
    // save text to storage
  }
  @Override
  public boolean equals(Object doc) {
    return doc instanceof Document
      && Document.class.cast(doc).id == this.id;
  }
  @Override
  public String toString() {
    return String.format("doc #%d about '%s'", this.id, this.title());
  }
}
```

Conceptually speaking, this document is acting as a proxy of a real-life
document that has a title stored somewhere---in a file, for example. This is
what a good object should do---be a proxy of a real-life entity.
The document exposes two features: reading the title and saving the title. Here is
how its [interface]({% pst 2016/apr/2016-04-26-why-inputstream-design-is-wrong %})
would look like:

```java
@Immutable
interface Document {
  String title();
  void title(String text);
}
```

`title()` reads the title of the document and returns it as a `String`,
and `title(String)` saves it back into the document. Imagine a real
paper document with a title. You ask an object to read that title from
the paper or to erase an existing one and write new text over it. This
paper is a "copy" utilized in these methods.

Now we can make frequent changes to the immutable document, and the
document stays the same. It doesn't stop being immutable, since it's
state (`id`) is not changed. It is the same document, even though we
change its title, because the title is not a state of the document. It
is something in the real world, outside of the document. The document
is just a proxy between us and that "something." Reading and writing
the title _are behaviors_ of the document, not its state.

## Mutable Memory

The only question we still have unanswered is what is that "copy"
and what happens if we need to keep the title of the document in memory?

Let's look at it from an "object thinking" point of view. We have a `document`
object, which [is supposed to represent]({% pst 2014/nov/2014-11-20-seven-virtues-of-good-object %}) a real-life entity in an
object-oriented world. If such an entity is a file, we can easily
implement `title()` methods. If such an entity is an Amazon S3 object,
we also implement title reading and writing methods easily, keeping the
object immutable. If such an entity is an HTTP page, we
have no issues in the implementation of title reading or writing, keeping the object immutable.
We have no issues as long as a real-world document exists and has its
own identity. Our title reading and writing methods will communicate with that
real-world document and extract or update its title.

{% youtube p7m7_iiqaHI %}

Problems arise when such an entity doesn't exist in a real world. In that
case, we need to create a mutable object property called `title`, read it via
`title()`, and modify it via `title(String)`. But an object is immutable,
so we can't have a mutable property in it---by definition! What do we do?

Think.

How could it be that our object doesn't represent a real-world entity?
Remember, the *real world* is everything around the living environment of an object.
Is it possible that an object doesn't represent anyone and acts
on its own? No, it's not possible. Every object is a representative of
a real-world entity. So, who does it represent if we want to keep `title` inside
it and we don't have any file or HTTP page behind the object?

{% badge /images/2014/12/memory-stick.png 200 %}

It represents *computer memory*.

The title of immutable document #50, "How to grill a sandwich,"
is stored in the memory, taking up 23 bytes of space. The document
should know where those bytes are stored, and it should be able to read them
and replace them with something else. Those 23 bytes are the real-world
entity that the object represents. The bytes have nothing to do with
the state of the object. They are a *mutable* real-world entity, similar
to a file, HTTP page, or an Amazon S3 object.

Unfortunately, Java (and many other modern languages) do not allow direct
access to computer memory. This is how we would design our class if such
direct access was possible:

```java
@Immutable
class Document {
  private final int id;
  private final Memory memory;
  Document(int id) {
    this.id = id;
    this.memory = new Memory();
  }
  public String title() {
    return new String(this.memory.read());
  }
  public void title(String text) {
    this.memory.write(text.getBytes());
  }
}
```

That `Memory` class would be implemented by JDK natively, and all other
classes would be immutable. The class `Memory` would have direct access
to the memory heap and would be responsible for
[`malloc` and `free`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_dynamic_memory_allocation)
operations on the operating system level.
Having such a class would allow us to make all Java classes immutable,
including `StringBuffer`, `ByteArrayOutputStream`, etc.

{% quote The role of an object is to make a piece of data alive, to animate it but not to become a piece of data %}

The `Memory` class would explicitly emphasize the mission of an object
in a software program, which is to be a *data animator*. An object is not
holding data; it is animating it. The data exists somewhere, and it is
[anemic]({% pst 2016/jul/2016-07-06-data-transfer-object %}),
static, motionless, stationary, etc. The data is **dead**
while the object is **alive**. The role of an object is to make a piece of data
alive, to *animate* it but not to become a piece of data. An object needs some
knowledge in order to gain access to that dead piece of data. An object
may need a database unique key, an HTTP address, a file name, or
a memory address in order to find the data and animate it. But an
object should never think of itself as data.

## What Is the Practical Solution?

{% youtube PVvLQGnyDrQ %}

Unfortunately, we don't have such a memory-representing class
in Java, Ruby, JavaScript, Python, PHP, and many other high-level languages.
It looks like language designers didn't get the idea of
alive objects vs. dead data, which is sad. We're forced to mix
data with object states using the same language constructs:
object variables and properties.
Maybe someday we'll have that `Memory` class in Java and other languages,
but until then, we have a few options.

**Use C++**.
In C++ and similar low-level languages, it is possible to access memory
directly and deal with in-memory data the same way we deal with
in-file or in-HTTP data. In C++, we can create that `Memory` class
and use it exactly the way we explained above.

**Use Arrays**.
In Java, an array is a data structure with a unique property---it can be modified while being declared as `final`. You can use
an array of bytes as a mutable data structure inside an immutable object.
It's a surrogate solution that conceptually resembles the `Memory` class
but is much more primitive.

{% quote A good object is an immutable animator of mutable data %}

**Avoid In-Memory Data**.
Try to avoid in-memory data as much as possible. In some domains, it is
easy to do; for example, in web apps, file processing, I/O adapters, etc.
However, in other domains, it is much easier said than done. For example,
in games, data manipulation algorithms, and GUI, most of the objects animate
in-memory data mostly because memory is the only resource they have.
In that case, without the `Memory` class, you end up with mutable objects :(
There is no workaround.

To summarize, don't forget that an object is an **animator** of data. It is using
its encapsulated knowledge in order to reach the data. No matter where
the data is stored---in a file, in HTTP, or in memory---it is
conceptually very different from an object state, even though they may
look very similar.

A good object is an immutable animator of mutable data. Even though it
is immutable and data is mutable, it is alive and data is dead
in the scope of the object's living environment.
