A simple example of `NULL` usage in Java:

```java
public Employee getByName(String name) {
  int id = database.find(name);
  if (id == 0) {
    return null;
  }
  return new Employee(id);
}
```

What is wrong with this method?

<!--more-->

It may return `NULL` instead of an object---that's what is wrong.
`NULL` is a terrible practice in an object-oriented paradigm and should be avoided at
[all costs]({% pst 2016/mar/2016-03-22-try-finally-if-not-null %}).
There have been a number of opinions about this published already, including
[Null References, The Billion Dollar Mistake](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Null-References-The-Billion-Dollar-Mistake-Tony-Hoare)
presentation by Tony Hoare and the entire
[Object Thinking](https://amzn.to/266oJr4)
book by David West.

Here, I'll try to summarize all the arguments and show examples of
how `NULL` usage can be avoided and replaced with proper object-oriented constructs.

Basically, there are two possible alternatives to `NULL`.

The first one is **[Null Object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_Object_pattern)**
design [pattern]({% pst 2016/feb/2016-02-03-design-patterns-and-anti-patterns %})
(the best way is to make it a constant):

```java
public Employee getByName(String name) {
  int id = database.find(name);
  if (id == 0) {
    return Employee.NOBODY;
  }
  return Employee(id);
}
```

The second possible alternative is to [fail fast]({% pst 2015/aug/2015-08-25-fail-fast %})
by throwing an **Exception** when you can't return an
[object]({% pst 2016/jul/2016-07-14-who-is-object %}):

```java
public Employee getByName(String name) {
  int id = database.find(name);
  if (id == 0) {
    throw new EmployeeNotFoundException(name);
  }
  return Employee(id);
}
```

Now, let's see the arguments against `NULL`.

Besides Tony Hoare's presentation and David West's book
mentioned above, I read these publications before writing this post:
[Clean Code](https://amzn.to/2m7LmaA) by Robert Martin,
[Code Complete](https://amzn.to/2cs4cXW) by Steve McConnell,
[Say "No" to "Null"](http://elegantcode.com/2010/05/01/say-no-to-null/) by John Sonmez,
[Is returning null bad design?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1274792/is-returning-null-bad-design) discussion at Stack Overflow.

## Ad-hoc Error Handling

Every time you get an object as an input you must
check whether it is `NULL` or a valid object reference.
If you forget to check, a [`NullPointerException`](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/NullPointerException.html) (NPE)
may break execution in runtime. Thus, your logic becomes
polluted with multiple checks and if/then/else forks:

```java
// this is a terrible design, don't reuse
Employee employee = dept.getByName("Jeffrey");
if (employee == null) {
  System.out.println("can't find an employee");
  System.exit(-1);
} else {
  employee.transferTo(dept2);
}
```

This is how exceptional situations are supposed to be handled in
[C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29) and
other imperative procedural languages. OOP introduced
[exception handling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_handling)
primarily to get rid of these ad-hoc error handling blocks.
In OOP, we let exceptions bubble up until they reach an application-wide
error handler and our code becomes much cleaner and shorter:

```java
dept.getByName("Jeffrey").transferTo(dept2);
```

Consider `NULL` references an inheritance of procedural programming,
and use 1) Null Objects or 2) Exceptions instead.

## Ambiguous Semantic

In order to explicitly convey its meaning, the function
`getByName()` has to be named `getByNameOrNullIfNotFound()`.
The same should happen with every function that returns an
object or `NULL`. Otherwise, ambiguity is inevitable for a code reader.
Thus, to keep semantic unambiguous, you should give longer names to functions.

To get rid of this ambiguity, always return a real object,
a null object or
[throw]({% pst 2015/dec/2015-12-01-rethrow-exceptions %}) an exception.

Some may argue that we sometimes have to return `NULL`,
for the sake of performance. For example, method `get()` of
interface [`Map`](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Map.html)
in Java returns `NULL` when there is no such item in the map:

```java
Employee employee = employees.get("Jeffrey");
if (employee == null) {
  throw new EmployeeNotFoundException();
}
return employee;
```

This code searches the map only once due to the usage of `NULL` in `Map`.
If we would refactor `Map` so that its method `get()` will throw
an exception if nothing is found, our code will look like this:

```java
if (!employees.containsKey("Jeffrey")) { // first search
  throw new EmployeeNotFoundException();
}
return employees.get("Jeffrey"); // second search
```

Obviously, this is method is twice as slow as the first one. What to do?

The `Map` interface (no offense to its authors) has a design flaw.
Its method `get()` should have been returning an
[`Iterator`]({% pst 2015/apr/2015-04-30-iterating-adapter %})
so that our code would look like:

```java
Iterator found = Map.search("Jeffrey");
if (!found.hasNext()) {
  throw new EmployeeNotFoundException();
}
return found.next();
```

BTW, that is exactly how C++ STL
[map::find()](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/map/find) method is designed.

## Computer Thinking vs. Object Thinking

Statement `if (employee == null)` is understood by someone who
knows that an object in Java is a pointer to a data structure and
that `NULL` is a pointer to nothing (`0x00000000`, in Intel x86 processors).

However, if you start thinking as an object, this statement
makes much less sense. This is how our code looks from an object point of view:

```text
- Hello, is it a software department?
- Yes.
- Let me talk to your employee "Jeffrey" please.
- Hold the line please...
- Hello.
- Are you NULL?
```

The last question in this conversation sounds weird, doesn't it?

Instead, if they hang up the phone after our request to speak
to Jeffrey, that causes a problem for us (Exception).
At that point, we try to call again or inform our supervisor
that we can't reach Jeffrey and complete a bigger transaction.

Alternatively, they may let us speak to another person,
who is not Jeffrey, but who can help with most of our questions
or refuse to help if we need something "Jeffrey specific" (Null Object).

## Slow Failing

Instead of [failing fast](https://martinfowler.com/ieeeSoftware/failFast.pdf),
the code above attempts to die slowly, killing others on its way.
Instead of letting everyone know that something went wrong and that an
exception handling should start immediately, it is hiding this failure from its client.

This argument is close to the "ad-hoc error handling" discussed above.

It is a good practice to make your code as fragile as possible,
letting it break when necessary.

{% youtube o3aNJX7AP3M %}

Make your methods extremely demanding as to the data
they manipulate. Let them complain by throwing exceptions,
if the provided data provided is not sufficient or simply
doesn't fit with the main usage scenario of the method.

Otherwise, return a Null Object, that exposes some common
behavior and throws exceptions on all other calls:

```java
public Employee getByName(String name) {
  int id = database.find(name);
  Employee employee;
  if (id == 0) {
    employee = new Employee() {
      @Override
      public String name() {
        return "anonymous";
      }
      @Override
      public void transferTo(Department dept) {
        throw new AnonymousEmployeeException(
          "I can't be transferred, I'm anonymous"
        );
      }
    };
  } else {
    employee = Employee(id);
  }
  return employee;
}
```

## Mutable and Incomplete Objects

In general, it is [highly recommended]({% pst 2014/jun/2014-06-09-objects-should-be-immutable %})
to design objects
with immutability in mind. This means that an object gets
all necessary knowledge during its instantiating and never
changes its state during the entire life-cycle.

Very often, `NULL` values are used in [lazy loading]({% pst 2017/oct/2017-10-17-lazy-loading-caching-sticky-cactoos %}),
to make objects incomplete and mutable. For example:

```java
public class Department {
  private Employee found = null;
  public synchronized Employee manager() {
    if (this.found == null) {
      this.found = new Employee("Jeffrey");
    }
    return this.found;
  }
}
```

This technology, although widely used, is an anti-pattern in
[OOP]({% pst 2016/aug/2016-08-15-what-is-wrong-object-oriented-programming %}).
Mostly because it makes an object responsible for performance problems
of the computational platform, which is something an `Employee` object should not be aware of.

Instead of managing a state and exposing its business-relevant behavior,
an object has to take care of the caching of its own results---this is what lazy loading is about.

Caching is not something an employee does in the office, does he?

The solution? Don't use lazy loading in such a primitive way,
as in the example above. Instead, [move]({% pst 2017/oct/2017-10-17-lazy-loading-caching-sticky-cactoos %})
this caching problem to
another layer of your application.

For example, in Java, you can use aspect-oriented programming aspects.
For example, [jcabi-aspects](https://aspects.jcabi.com) has
[`@Cacheable`](https://aspects.jcabi.com/annotation-cacheable.html)
annotation that caches the value returned by a method:

```java
import com.jcabi.aspects.Cacheable;
public class Department {
  @Cacheable(forever = true)
  public Employee manager() {
    return new Employee("Jacky Brown");
  }
}
```

I hope this analysis was convincing enough that you will
stop `NULL`-ing your code.

p.s. If you are interested in a more scientific arguments against NULL,
read [this recently published research paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9392959)
that empirically demonstrates
a correlation between the intensity of NULL usage and cognitive
complexity---the more NULL is seen in a class, the higher the complexity of its methods.
