[Rultor](https://www.rultor.com) is a coding team assistant.
[Travis](http://travis-ci.org) is a hosted
[continuous integration]({% pst 2014/oct/2014-10-08-continuous-integration-is-dead %}) system.
In this article I'll show how our open source projects are
using them in tandem to achieve seamless continuous delivery.

I'll show a few practical scenarios.

<!--more-->

## Scenario #1: Merge Pull Request

[`jcabi-mysql-maven-plugin`](https://github.com/jcabi/jcabi-mysql-maven-plugin)
is a Maven plugin for [MySQL integration testing]({% pst 2014/may/2014-05-21-mysql-maven-plugin %}).
[`@ChristianRedl`](https://github.com/ChristianRedl) submitted pull request
[#35](https://github.com/jcabi/jcabi-mysql-maven-plugin/pull/35) with a new feature.
I reviewed the request and asked Rultor to merge it into `master`:

{% figure /images/2014/07/rultor-mysql-35.png 600 %}

As you can see, an actual merge operation was made by Rultor.
I gave him access to the project by adding his GitHub account to
the list of project collaborators.

Before giving a "go ahead" to Rultor I checked the status
of the pre-build reported by Travis:

{% figure /images/2014/07/rultor-mysql-35-2.png 600 %}

Travis found a new commit in the pull request and immediately
(without any interaction from my side) triggered a build in that branch.
The build didn't fail, that's why Travis gave me a green sign.
I looked at that sign and at the code. Since all problems in the code
were corrected by the pull request author and Travis didn't complain---I gave a "go" to Rultor.

## Scenario #2: Continuous Integration

Even though the previous step [guarantees]({% pst 2014/jul/2014-07-21-read-only-master-branch %})
that `master` branch is always clean and stable, we're using Travis to
continuously integrate it. Every commit made to `master` triggers
a new build in Travis. The result of the build changes the status
of the project in Travis: either "failing" or "passing."

[`jcabi-aspects`](https://aspects.jcabi.com) is a collection of
[AOP AspectJ aspects]({% pst 2014/jun/2014-06-01-aop-aspectj-java-method-logging %}).
We configured Travis to build it continuously. This is the badge it produces (the left one):

{% figure /images/2014/07/rultor-aspects.png 600 %}

Again, let me stress that even through
[read-only master]({% pst 2014/jul/2014-07-21-read-only-master-branch %})
is a strong protection against broken builds, it doesn't guarantee that
at any moment master is stable. For example, sometimes unit tests
fail sporadically due to changes in calendar, in environment, in dependencies,
in network connection qualities, etc.

Well, ideally, unit tests should either fail or pass because they
are environment independent. However, in reality, unit tests are far
from being ideal.

That's why a combination of [read-only master]({% pst 2014/jul/2014-07-21-read-only-master-branch %})
with Rultor and
[continuous integration]({% pst 2014/oct/2014-10-08-continuous-integration-is-dead %})
with Travis gives us higher stability.

## Scenario #3: Release to RubyGems

[`jekyll-github-deploy`](https://github.com/yegor256/jekyll-github-deploy)
is a Ruby gem that [automates deployment of Jekyll sites to GitHub Pages]({% pst 2014/jun/2014-06-24-jekyll-github-deploy %}).
[`@leucos`](https://github.com/leucos) submitted a pull request
[#4](https://github.com/yegor256/jekyll-github-deploy/pull/4)
with a new feature. The request was merged successfully into `master` branch.

Then, Rultor was instructed by myself that `master` branch should be
released to RubyGems and a new version to set is 1.5:

{% figure /images/2014/07/rultor-jekyll-4.png 600 %}

Rultor executed a simple script, [pre-configured](https://doc.rultor.com/basics.html#release) in its
[`.rultor.yml`](https://github.com/yegor256/jekyll-github-deploy/blob/master/.rultor.yml):

```text
release:
  script: |
    ./test.sh
    rm -rf *.gem
    sed -i "s/2.0-SNAPSHOT/${tag}/g" jgd.gemspec
    gem build jgd.gemspec
    chmod 0600 ../rubygems.yml
    gem push *.gem --config-file ../rubygems.yml
```

The script is parameterized, as you see. There is one parameter that
is passed by Rultor into the script: `${tag}`. This parameter was
provided by myself in the GitHub issue, when I submitted a command to Rultor.

The script tests that the gem works (integration testing) and
clean up afterwords:

```bash
$ ./test.sh
$ rm -rf *.gem
```

Then, it changes the version of itself in `jgd.gemspec` to
the one provided in the `${tag}` (it is an environment variable),
and builds a new `.gem`:

```bash
$ sed -i "s/2.0-SNAPSHOT/${tag}/g" jgd.gemspec
$ gem build jgd.gemspec
```

Finally, it pushes a newly built `.gem` to
[RubyGems]({% pst 2014/aug/2014-08-26-publish-to-rubygems %}),
using login credentials from `../rubygems.yml`. This file is created by
Rultor right before starting the script (this mechanism is discussed below):

```bash
$ chmod 0600 ../rubygems.yml
$ gem push *.gem --config-file ../rubygems.yml
```

If everything works fine and RubyGems confirms successful deployment,
Rultor reports to GitHub. This is exactly what happened in
[pull request #4](https://github.com/yegor256/jekyll-github-deploy/pull/4).

## Scenario #4: Deploy to CloudBees

[s3auth.com](https://www.s3auth.com) is a
[Basic HTTP authentication gateway for Amazon S3 Buckets]({% pst 2014/apr/2014-04-21-s3-http-basic-auth %}).
It is a Java web app.
In its pull request [#195](https://github.com/yegor256/s3auth/pull/195), a resource
leakage problem was fixed by [`@carlosmiranda`](https://github.com/carlosmiranda)
and the pull request was merged by Rultor.

Then, [`@davvd`](https://github.com/davvd) instructed Rultor to deploy
`master` branch to production environment. Rultor created
[a new Docker container]({% pst 2014/jul/2014-07-29-docker-in-rultor %})
and ran `mvn clean deploy` in it.

Maven deployed the application to [CloudBees](https://www.cloudbees.com):

{% figure /images/2014/07/rultor-s3auth-195.png 600 %}

The overall procedure took 21 minutes, as you see the in the report generated by Rultor.

There is one important trick worth mentioning. Deployment to
production always means using secure credentials, like login, password, SSH keys, etc.

In this particular example, [Maven CloudBees  Plugin](https://wiki.cloudbees.com/bin/view/RUN/MavenGuide)
needed API key, secret and web application name. These three parameters are kept secure
and can't be revealed in an "[open source]({% pst 2015/dec/2015-12-22-why-dont-you-contribute-to-open-source %})" way.

So, there is [a mechanism](https://doc.rultor.com/reference.html#assets)
that configures Rultor accordingly through its
[`.rultor.yml`](https://github.com/yegor256/s3auth/blob/master/.rultor.yml)
file (pay attention to the first few lines):

```text
assets:
  settings.xml: "yegor256/home#assets/s3auth/settings.xml"
  pubring.gpg: "yegor256/home#assets/pubring.gpg"
  secring.gpg: "yegor256/home#assets/secring.gpg"
```

These YAML entries inform Rultor that it has to get `assets/s3auth/settings.xml`
file from `yegor256/home` private (!) GitHub repository and put it into
the working directory of Docker container, right before starting the Maven build.

This `settings.xml` file contains that secret data CloudBees
plugin needs in order to deploy the application.

[How to Deploy to CloudBees, in One Click]({% pst 2014/aug/2014-08-25-deploy-to-cloudbees %})
explains this process even better.

## You Can Do The Same

Both Rultor and Travis are free hosted products, provided your
projects are open source and hosted at GitHub.

Other good examples of Rultor+Travis usage can be seen in these GitHub issues:
[`jcabi/jcabi-http#47`](https://github.com/jcabi/jcabi-http/issues/47),
[`jcabi/jcabi-http#48`](https://github.com/jcabi/jcabi-http/pull/48)

PS. You can do something similar with AppVeyor, for Windows platform:
