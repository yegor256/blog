  Monetary awards can be very demotivating or they
  can be very effective. It depends on your ability
  to define strict ground rules of work.

Monetary rewards for employees. Do they work? Should we use them?
Can money motivate creative minds? Will a programmer work
better if he gets paid only when he reaches his goals and objectives?

Much research has already been done on this subject,
and most of it proves that connecting results with money
is a very demotivating approach. For example, Ian Larkin
[says](http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/7215.html) that the most productive workers
"suffered a 6-8% decrease in productivity after the award was instituted."

I believe this is completely true. Money may become a terrible de-motivator
for all modern employees (not just programmers).

My question is---why is this so?

Why doesn't money work, even when it was invented to be
a universal instrument to measure our labor? Why can't an American dollar,
which has been used for centuries as a trading tool between working
people, be used anymore?

Why, in a [modern office]({% pst 2015/oct/2015-10-06-how-to-be-good-office-slave %}),
do we try to hide
[monetary]({% pst 2016/jan/2016-01-12-good-programmers-dont-work-for-equity %})
motivation and replace it with
[everything else](https://www.hrworld.com/features/25-employee-rewards/),
like free lunches, team building events,
paid vacations, etc. Why don't we just say---"Jeff completed his task faster than
everybody else. This is his $500 check. Whoever completes the
next task gets $300," out loud in the office?... Sounds uncomfortable, doesn't it?

Why does money as a motivator scare us?

{% youtube F6NwcQyEY18 %}

I have an answer.

Money doesn't work when there are no ground rules.

When we say that Jeff will get a $500 bonus if he finishes his task on time, but
don't say what he should do when someone distracts him---Jeff
gets frustrated. He also doesn't understand who his boss is anymore. Does
he just work for the bonus, or should he also satisfy a CTO who comes to his
desk asking him to do something else urgently? Is Jeff allowed to tell the CTO "to get lost"
because he's working towards his own personal objective (the bonus)?

In all cases I've seen myself and in all research cases I've read about,
people keep repeating the same mistake. They create a rewards program
(monetary or not) without setting ground rules for the team. By doing so,
they encourage people to play wild-wild west, where the fastest gets the
cash bag. Obviously, the Bad and the Ugly get to the prize faster, while
the Good gets demotivated and depressed.

What do I mean by ground rules?

It should be a simple document
([PMBOK](https://www.pmi.org/PMBOK-Guide-and-Standards.aspx)
calls it a Staffing Management Plan) that helps me, as a team member,
answer at least these basic questions:

  * How my personal results are measured?
  * Who gives me tasks and who do I report to?
  * How should I resolve [conflicts]({% pst 2017/jan/2017-01-03-how-much-you-love-conflicts %}) between tasks?
  * What are my personal deadlines for every task?
  * Do I have measurable quality expectations for my deliverables?
  * How do my mistakes affect my performance grade?

The [ground rules]({% pst 2015/oct/2015-10-13-competition-without-rules %})
document should be superior to your boss. If the document
says that your results get an A+ grade, the boss should have **no say**. If she
doesn't like you personally, it doesn't matter. You get an A+ grade, and you
are the best. That's it.

Does your team have such a document? Can you answer all of these questions?
If not, you're not ready for a rewards program. It will only
make your management situation worse, just like all the
scientific research says. Rewards will motivate
the most cunning to take advantage of the most hard
working and good-natured. Team spirit will suffer, big time.

{% quote Fair competition leads to a better cumulative result. %}

On the other hand, if you have that "[ground rules]({% pst 2015/oct/2015-10-13-competition-without-rules %})" document and you
strictly follow it, giving monetary rewards to your workers will
significantly increase their performance and motivation. They will
know exactly what needs to be done to get the rewards, and they won't have
any distraction. Your team won't be a group of wild west gunslingers anymore, but more like players in a
sports arena. The best players will go further, and the worst will
know exactly what needs to be done to improve. Fair competition
will lead to a better cumulative result.

Moreover, if your ground rules are strict and explicit, you can
use not only rewards, but also
[punishments]({% pst 2016/jan/2016-01-05-how-to-punish-employees %}). And your team will
[gladly]({% pst 2015/sep/2015-09-16-how-to-fire-someone-right %}) accept
them, because they will help emphasize
what (and who) works best and help get rid of the waste.

I'm speaking from experience here. In [XDSD](https://www.xdsd.org)
we're not only rewarding programmers with money, but we also never pay
for anything except delivered results. We manage to do this mostly because
our ground rules are very strict and non-ambiguous. And we never
break them.
