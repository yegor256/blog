This is the first post on my new blog.
Therefore, it's not about anything in particular---just
an introduction and my way of saying hello. This blog will
be primarily about software development
ideas. As my [About Me](/about-me.html) page says,
I'm passionate about software
quality, and will write solely about my ideas and
views on it.

Anyway, welcome to my new blog. Together, let's see how
this works out!

BTW, I purchased the
[Cambria font](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ascender/cambria/)
just for this new blog. It cost, &euro;98. Nevertheless, I think
it's a good investment for this new venture.
