In this post, I'll try to walk you through a project managed
with the spirit of
[Puzzle Driven Development]({% pst 2010/mar/2010-03-04-pdd %})
(PDD). As I do this, I will attempt to convey typical points
of view of various project members.

Basically, there are a few key
[roles]({% pst 2016/jul/2016-07-10-software-project-roles %}) in any software team:

 * Project Manager---assigns tasks and pays on completion
 * System Analyst---documents the product owner's ideas
 * Architect---defines how system components interact
 * Designer---implements most complex components
 * Programmer---implements all components
 * Tester---finds and reports bugs

Everybody, except the
[project manager]({% pst 2016/may/2016-05-24-who-is-project-manager %}),
affects the project in two
ways: they fix it and they break it at the same time. Let me explain
this with a simple example.

<!--more-->

## Fix and Break

Let's assume, for the sake of simplicity, that a project is a simple
software tool written by me for a close friend. I created the
first draft version 0.0.1 and delivered it to him. For me, the project
is done. I've completed the work, and hopefully will never have to return to it again.

{% youtube nsYGC2aUwfQ %}

However, the reality of the project is very different. In just a few hours,
I receive a call from my friend saying that a he's found a few bugs in the tool. He is asking me
to fix them. Now, I can see that the project is not done. In fact, it's broken.
It has a few bugs in it, which means a few tasks to complete.

I'm going to fix the project, by removing the bugs. I implement
a new version of the software, name it 0.0.2 and ship it to my friend. Again, I believe my project is finished. It is fixed and should be closed.

This scenario repeats itself again and again until my friend stops
calling me. In other words, until he stops breaking my project.

It is obvious that the more my friend breaks my project, the higher
the [quality]({% pst 2017/apr/2017-04-11-flexibility-equates-lower-quality %}) of the software delivered ultimately at the end.
Version 0.0.1 was just a very preliminary version, although I considered it final at
the time I released it. In a few months, after I learn of and fix
hundreds of bugs, version 3.5.17 will be much more mature and stable.

This is the result of this "fix and break" approach.

{% picture /images/2014/04/time-and-mess-diagram.png %}

The diagram shows the relation between time and mess in the project.
The bugs my friend is reporting to me are breaking the project, increasing
its instability (or simply its messiness). New versions I release resolve
the bugs and are fixing the project. Your
[GitHub]({% pst 2014/apr/2014-04-15-github-guidelines %})
commit dynamics should resemble this graph, for example:

{% picture /images/2014/04/jcabi-github-commits-graph.png %}

When the project starts, its messiness is rather low, and then it starts to grow. The messiness then
reaches its peak and starts to go down.

## Project Manager

The job of a project
[manager]({% pst 2015/sep/2015-09-22-micromanagement %})
is to do as much as possible
to fix the project. He has to use the sponsor's time and money in order
to remove all bugs and inconsistencies and return the project back
to a "fixed" state.

{% jb_picture_body %}

When I say "bugs," I mean more than just software errors but also:

 * unclear or ambiguous [requirements]({% pst 2015/nov/2015-11-10-ten-mistakes-in-specs %})
 * features not yet implemented
 * functional and non-functional bugs
 * lack of test coverage
 * unresolved `todo` markers
 * lack of risk analysis
 * etc.

The project manager gives me tasks that he wants done in order
to fix and stabilize the project to return it back to a
bug-free state.

My job, as a member of a software team, is to help him perform the needed fixes and, at the same time, do my best to break the project!
In the example with my friend, he was breaking the
project constantly by reporting bugs to me. This is how he helped both of us
increase the final quality of the product.

I should do the same and always try to report new bugs when I'm
working on some feature. I should **fix and break** at the same time.

Now let's take a closer look at project roles.

## System Analyst

A product owner submits an informal feature request, which usually
starts with "it would be nice to have..." I'm a system analyst and my
job is to translate owner's English into
[formal specifications]({% pst 2015/nov/2015-11-10-ten-mistakes-in-specs %}) in the SRS,
understandable both by programmers and myself. It's not my responsibility
to implement the feature.

{% picture /images/2014/04/arizona-dream-two-beers-and-two-shots.png 0 Arizona Dream (1992) by Emir Kusturica %}

My task is complete when a new version of the SRS is signed by the
Change Control Board. I'm an interpreter for the product owners, translating
from their language to formal language needed in the SRS document.
My only customer is the product owner. As soon as she closes the
feature request, I'll be paid.

Besides feature requests from product owners, I often receive
complaints about the quality of the SRS. The document may not be clear
enough for some team members. Therefore, it's my job to resolve clarity problems
and fix the SRS. These team members are also my customers. When they
close their [bug reports]({% pst 2018/apr/2018-04-24-right-way-to-report-bugs %}), I'll be paid.

In both cases (a feature request or a bug,) I can make changes to the
SRS immediately - if I have enough time. However, it's not always
possible. I can submit a bug and wait for its resolution; but, I don't
want to keep my customers waiting.

{% youtube LmSaC_OjIbQ %}

This is where puzzle driven development
helps me. Instead of submitting bug reports, I add
"[TBD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_be_announced)" puzzles in
the SRS document. The puzzles are informal replacements of normally very strict
formal requirements. They satisfy my customer, since they are in
plain English, and are understandable by technical people.

Thus, when I don't have time, I don't wait. I change the SRS
using TBD-s at points where I can't create a proper and formal description of the
requirements or simply don't know what to write exactly.

## Architect

Now, I'm the [architect]({% pst 2016/jul/2016-07-21-convince-me %}),
and my task is to implement a requirement, which has been formally specified
in the SRS. PM is expecting a working feature from me, which I can deliver
only when the architecture is clear and classes have been designed and implemented.

{% picture /images/2014/04/science-of-sleep-time-machine.png 0 The Science of Sleep (2006) by Michel Gondry %}

Being an architect, I'm responsible for assembling all of the components
together and making sure they fit. In most cases,
I'm not creating them myself, but I'm telling everybody how they should
be created. My work flow of artifacts is the following:

{% plantuml style="width:75%" %}
[SRS] -> [UML]
[UML] -> [Source code]
{% endplantuml %}

I receive [requirements]({% pst 2015/nov/2015-11-10-ten-mistakes-in-specs %})
from the SRS, produce UML diagrams and
explain to designers how to create source code according to my diagrams.
I don't really care how source code is implemented. I'm more concerned
with the interaction of components and how well the entire architecture satisfies
functional and non-functional (!) requirements.

My task will be closed and paid when the system analyst
changes its state to "implemented" in the SRS. The system analyst is my only
customer. I have to sell my solution to him. Project manager
will close my task and pay me when system analyst changes
the status of the functional requirement from "specified" to "implemented."

The task sounds big, and I have only half an hour. Obviously,
puzzle driven development should help me. I will create many tickets and
puzzles. For example:

 * SRS doesn't explain requirements properly
 * Non-functional requirements are not clear
 * UML diagrams are not clear enough
 * Components are not implemented
 * Build is not automated
 * Continuous integration is not configured
 * Quality of code is not under control
 * Performance testing is not automated

When all of my puzzles are resolved, I can get back to my main task
and finish feature implementation. Obviously, this may take a long time - days or even weeks.

But, the time cost of the main task is less than an hour.
What is the point of all this hard work? Well, it's simple;
I'll earn my hours from all the bugs reported.
From this small half-an-hour task, I will generate many tickets, and every one of them will give me extra cash.


## Designer and Programmer

The only real differences between designer and programmer are the complexity
of their respective tasks and the hourly rates they receive. Designers usually do more complex
and higher level implementations, while programmers implement all
low-level details.

{% picture /images/2014/04/pulp-fiction-vincent-and-jules.png 0 Pulp Fiction (1994) by Quentin Tarantino %}

I'm a programmer and my task is to implement a class or method or to
fix some functional bug. In most cases, I have only half an hour available.
And, most tasks are bigger and require more time than that.

Puzzle driven development helps me break my task into smaller sub-tasks.
I [always]({% pst 2017/mar/2017-03-24-tdd-that-works %})
start with a unit test. In the unit test, I'm trying to
reproduce a bug or model the feature. When my test fails, I commit
it and determine the amount of time I have left. If I still have time to make it
pass---I do it, commit the changes and report to the project manager.

If I don't have time to implement the fix, I mark pieces of code that
don't already have `todo` markers, commit them and report to the
project manager that I've finished.

As you see, I'm fixing the code and breaking it at the same time. I'm fixing
it with my new unit test, but breaking it with `todo` puzzles.

This is how I help to increase the overall quality of the project - by
fixing and breaking at the same time.

## Tester

I'm a tester and my primary motivation is to find bugs. This may be
contradictory to what you've heard before; but in [XDSD](https://www.xdsd.org), we plan
to find a certain amount of bugs at every stage of the project.

{% picture /images/2014/04/fear-and-loathing-adrenochrome.png 0 Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998) by Terry Gilliam %}

As as a tester, I receive tasks from my project manager. These tasks usually resemble "review feature X and find 10 bugs in it." The project manager
needs a certain number of bugs to be found in order to fix the project.
From his point of view, the project is fixed when, say, 200 bugs have been found. That's why he asks me to find more.

Thus, to respond to the request, i find bugs to do my part in regard to the "fixing" part
of the bigger picture. At the same time, though, I can find defects on my own
and report them. This is the "breaking" part of my mission.
