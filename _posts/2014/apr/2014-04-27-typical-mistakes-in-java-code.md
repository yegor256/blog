This page contains most typical mistakes I see in the Java code of people
working with me. Static analysis (we're using [qulice](https://www.qulice.com)
can't catch all of the mistakes for obvious reasons, and that's why I decided to
list them all here.

<!--more-->

Let me know if you want to see something else added here, and I'll be happy to
oblige.

All of the listed mistakes are related to object-oriented programming in general
and to Java in particular.

## Class Names

Your class should be an abstraction of a real life entity
with no "validators," "controllers," "managers," etc.
If your class name ends with an "-er"---it's [a bad design](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DontNameClassesObjectManagerHandlerOrData).
BTW, here are my
[seven virtues]({% pst 2014/nov/2014-11-20-seven-virtues-of-good-object %})
of a good object.
Also, this post explains this idea in more details:
[Don't Create Objects That End With -ER]({% pst 2015/mar/2015-03-09-objects-end-with-er %}).

And, of course, utility classes are anti-patterns, like [`StringUtils`](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/javadocs/api-2.6/org/apache/commons/lang/StringUtils.html),
[`FileUtils`](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-io/javadocs/api-2.5/org/apache/commons/io/FileUtils.html), and
[`IOUtils`](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-io/javadocs/api-2.5/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.html) from Apache.
The above are perfect examples of terrible designs. Read this follow up post:
[OOP Alternative to Utility Classes]({% pst 2014/may/2014-05-05-oop-alternative-to-utility-classes %})

Of course, never add suffixes or prefixes to
distinguish between [interfaces and classes](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DontDistinguishBetweenClassesAndInterfaces).
For example, all of these names are terribly wrong: `IRecord`, `IfaceEmployee`, or `RecordInterface`.
Usually, interface name is the name of a real-life entity, while class name should explain its implementation details.
If there is nothing specific to say about an implementation, name it `Default,` `Simple`, or something similar. For example:

```java
class SimpleUser implements User {};
class DefaultRecord implements Record {};
class Suffixed implements Name {};
class Validated implements Content {};
```

## Method Names

Methods can either return something or return `void`. If a method returns
something, then its name should explain *what it returns*, for example (don't
use the `get` prefix [ever]({% pst 2014/sep/2014-09-16-getters-and-setters-are-evil %})):

```java
boolean isValid(String name);
String content();
int ageOf(File file);
```

If it returns `void,` then its name should explain *what it does*. For example:

```java
void save(File file);
void process(Work work);
void append(File file, String line);
```

You can read more about this idea in
[Elegant Objects](/elegant-objects.html) book,
section [2.4](/images/books/elegant-objects/contents.pdf).
There is only one exception to the rule just mentioned---test methods for JUnit. They are explained below.

## Test Method Names

Method names in JUnit tests should be created as English sentences without
spaces. It's easier to explain by example:

```java
/**
 * HttpRequest can return its content in Unicode.
 * @throws Exception If test fails
 */
@Test
public void returnsItsContentInUnicode() throws Exception {
}
```

It's important to start the first sentence of your Javadoc with the name of the
class you're testing followed by `can` (or `cannot`). So, your first sentence should always be
similar to "somebody _can_ do something."

The method name will state exactly the same, but without the subject. If I add a
subject at the beginning of the method name, I should get a complete English
sentence, as in above example: "`HttpRequest` returns its content in Unicode."

Pay attention that the test method doesn't start with `can`. Only Javadoc
comments use 'can.'

It's a good practice to always declare test methods as throwing `Exception`.

## Variable Names

Avoid composite names of variables, like `timeOfDay`, `firstItem`, or
`httpRequest`. I mean with both---class variables and in-method ones. A
variable name should be long enough to avoid ambiguity in its scope of
visibility, but not too long if possible. A name should be a noun in singular or
plural form, or an appropriate abbreviation. More about it in
this post: [A Compound Name Is a Code Smell]({% pst 2015/jan/2015-01-12-compound-name-is-code-smell %}).
For example:

```java
List<String> names;
void sendThroughProxy(File file, Protocol proto);
private File content;
public HttpRequest request;
```

Sometimes, you may have collisions between
[constructor]({% pst 2015/may/2015-05-07-ctors-must-be-code-free %})
parameters and in-class
properties if the constructor saves incoming data in an instantiated object. In
this case, I recommend to create abbreviations by removing vowels (see how
[USPS abbreviates street names](http://pe.usps.gov/text/pub28/28apc_002.htm)).

Another example:

```java
public class Message {
  private String recipient;
  public Message(String rcpt) {
    this.recipient = rcpt;
  }
}
```

In many cases, the best hint for a name of a variable can ascertained by reading
its class name. Just write it with a small letter, and you should be good:

```java
File file;
User user;
Branch branch;
```

However, *never* do the same for primitive types, like `Integer number` or `String string`.

You can also use an adjective, when there are multiple variables with different characteristics. For instance:

```java
String contact(String left, String right);
```

## Constructors

Without
[exceptions]({% pst 2016/jun/2016-06-17-dont-use-java-assertions %}),
there should be only _one_ constructor that stores data in
object variables. All other constructors should call this one with different
arguments. For example:

```java
public class Server {
  private String address;
  public Server(String uri) {
    this.address = uri;
  }
  public Server(URI uri) {
    this(uri.toString());
  }
}
```

More about it in
[There Can Be Only One Primary Constructor]({% pst 2015/may/2015-05-28-one-primary-constructor %}).

## One-time Variables

Avoid one-time variables at all costs. By "one-time" I mean variables that are
used only once. Like in this example:

```java
String name = "data.txt";
return new File(name);
```

This above variable is used only once and the code should be refactored to:

```java
return new File("data.txt");
```

Sometimes, in very rare cases---mostly because of better formatting---one-time
variables may be used. Nevertheless, try to avoid such situations at all costs.

## Exceptions

Needless to say, you should **never** swallow exceptions, but rather let them
bubble up as high as possible. Private methods should always let checked
exceptions go out.

Never use exceptions for flow control. For example this code is wrong:

```java
int size;
try {
  size = this.fileSize();
} catch (IOException ex) {
  size = 0;
}
```

Seriously, what if that `IOException` says "disk is full?" Will you still assume
that the size of the file is zero and move on?

## Indentation

For indentation, the [main rule]({% pst 2014/oct/2014-10-23-paired-brackets-notation %})
is that a bracket should either end a line or be
closed on the same line (reverse rule applies to a closing bracket). For
example, the following is not correct because the first bracket is not closed on
the same line and there are symbols after it. The second bracket is also in
trouble because there are symbols in front of it and it is not opened on the
same line:

```java
final File file = new File(directory,
  "file.txt");
```

Correct indentation should look like:

```java
StringUtils.join(
  Arrays.asList(
    "first line",
    "second line",
    StringUtils.join(
      Arrays.asList("a", "b")
    )
  ),
  "separator"
);
```

The second important rule of indentation says that you should put as much as possible on one line - within the limit of 80 characters. The example above is not valid since it can be compacted:

```java
StringUtils.join(
  Arrays.asList(
    "first line", "second line",
    StringUtils.join(Arrays.asList("a", "b"))
  ),
  "separator"
);
```

## Redundant Constants

Class constants should be used when you want to share information between class
methods, and this information is a characteristic (!) of your class. Don't use
constants as a replacement of string or numeric literals---very bad
practice that leads to code pollution. Constants (as with any
[object]({% pst 2016/jul/2016-07-14-who-is-object %}) in
[OOP]({% pst 2016/aug/2016-08-15-what-is-wrong-object-oriented-programming %}))
should have a meaning in a real world. What meaning do these constants have in
the real world:

```java
class Document {
  private static final String D_LETTER = "D"; // bad practice
  private static final String EXTENSION = ".doc"; // good practice
}
```

Another typical mistake is to use constants in
[unit tests]({% pst 2017/may/2017-05-17-single-statement-unit-tests %}) to avoid duplicate
string/numeric literals in test methods.
[Don't do this]({% pst 2016/may/2016-05-03-test-methods-must-share-nothing %})!
Every test method should work with its own set of input values.

Use new texts and numbers in every new test method. They are independent. So,
why do they have to share the same input constants?

## Test Data Coupling

This is an example of [data coupling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_%28computer_programming%29) in a test method:

```java
User user = new User("Jeff");
// maybe some other code here
MatcherAssert.assertThat(user.name(), Matchers.equalTo("Jeff"));
```

On the last line, we couple `"Jeff"` with the same string literal from the first
line. If, a few months later, someone wants to change the value on the third
line, he/she has to spend extra time finding where else `"Jeff"` is used in the
same method.

To avoid this data coupling, you should introduce a variable.
