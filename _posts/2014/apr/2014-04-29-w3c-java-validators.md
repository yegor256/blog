A few years ago, I created two Java wrappers for W3C validators: ([HTML](http://validator.w3.org/) and
[CSS](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)).
Both wrappers seemed to be working fine and were
even listed by W3C on [their website](http://validator.w3.org/docs/api.html)
in the API section. Until recently, these wrappers have
always been part of [ReXSL](https://github.com/yegor256/rexsl) library.

A few days ago, though, I took the wrappers out of ReXSL
and published them as a standalone library---[jcabi-w3c](http://w3c.jcabi.com). Consequently, now seems
to be a good time to write a few words about them.

Below is an example that demonstrates how you can validate
an HTML document against W3C compliance rules:

```java
import com.jcabi.w3c.ValidatorBuilder;
assert ValidatorBuilder.html()
  .validate("<html>hello, world!</html>")
  .valid();
```

<!--more-->

The `valid()` method is a black or white indicator that
returns `false` when the document is not valid. Additionally,
you can obtain more information through a list of "defects" returned by the W3C server:

```java
Collection<Defect> defects = ValidatorBuilder.html()
  .validate("<html>hello, world!</html>")
  .errors();
```

The same can be done with CSS:

```java
Collection<Defect> defects = ValidatorBuilder.css()
  .validate("body { font-family: Arial; }")
  .errors();
```

Personally, I think it is a good practice to validate all
of HTML pages produced by your application against W3C during
integration testing. It's not a matter of seeking perfection,
but rather of preventing bigger problems later.

These dependencies are mandatory when using jcabi-w3c
(get their latest versions in [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/)):
