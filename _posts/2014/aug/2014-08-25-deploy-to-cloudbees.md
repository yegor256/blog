When I deploy a new version of [stateful.co](https://www.stateful.co),
a Java web application, to CloudBees, it takes 30 seconds of my time.
Maybe even less. Recently, I deployed version 1.6.5. You can see
how it all happened, in [GitHub issue #6](https://github.com/sttc/stateful/issues/6):

{% figure /images/2014/08/github-sttc-issue-6.png 600 %}

As you see, I gave a command to [Rultor](https://www.rultor.com),
and it packaged, tested and deployed a new version to CloudBees.
I didn't do anything else.

Now let's see how you can do the same. How you can configure your project
so that the deployment of its new version to CloudBees
takes just a few seconds of your time.

Since CloudBees is
<a href="https://www.cloudbees.com/press/cloudbees-becomes-enterprise-jenkins-company">shutting down its PaaS service</a>
by the end of December, 2014,
this article will have no sense after that.

## Configure the CloudBees Maven Plugin

Add this profile to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<project>
  [..]
  <profiles>
    <profile>
      <id>cloudbees</id>
      <activation>
        <property><name>bees.appId</name></property>
      </activation>
      <pluginRepositories>
        <pluginRepository>
          <id>cloudbees-public-release</id>
          <url>
            http://repository-cloudbees.forge.cloudbees.com/public-release
          </url>
        </pluginRepository>
      </pluginRepositories>
      <build>
        <pluginManagement>
          <plugins>
            <plugin>
              <artifactId>maven-deploy-plugin</artifactId>
              <configuration>
                  <skip>true</skip>
              </configuration>
            </plugin>
          </plugins>
        </pluginManagement>
        <plugins>
          <plugin>
            <groupId>com.cloudbees</groupId>
            <artifactId>bees-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>1.3.2</version>
            <configuration>
              <appid>${bees.id}</appid>
              <apikey>${bees.key}</apikey>
              <secret>${bees.secret}</secret>
            </configuration>
            <executions>
              <execution>
                <id>deploy-to-production</id>
                <phase>deploy</phase>
                <goals>
                  <goal>deploy</goal>
                </goals>
              </execution>
            </executions>
          </plugin>
        </plugins>
      </build>
    </profile>
  </profiles>
</project>
```

This plugin is not in Maven Central (unfortunately). That's why
we have to specify that `<pluginRepository>`.

Pay attention to the fact that we're also disabling `maven-deploy-plugin`, since
it would try to deploy your WAR package to the repository from the
`<distributionManagement>` section. We want to avoid this.

The profile gets activated only when the `bees.id` property
is defined. This won't happen during your normal development and testing,
but it will occur during the deployment cycle initiated by Rultor, because
we will define this property in `settings.xml` (discussed below).

## Secure Access to CloudBees

Create an account in CloudBees and register your web application there.
CloudBees is free, as long as you don't need too much computing power. I believe
that web applications should be light-weight by definition, so CloudBees' free
layer is an ideal choice.

Create a `settings.xml` file (but don't commit it to your repo!):

```xml
<settings>
  <profiles>
    <profile>
      <id>cloudbees</id>
      <properties>
        <bees.id>stateful/web</bees.id>
        <bees.key><!-- your key --></bees.key>
        <bees.secret><!-- your secret --></bees.secret>
      </properties>
    </profile>
  </profiles>
</settings>
```

Encrypt this file using [rultor remote](https://github.com/yegor256/rultor-remote):

```xml
$ gem install rultor
$ rultor encrypt -p me/test settings.xml
```

Instead of `me/test` use the name of your GitHub project.

You should get a `settings.xml.asc` file; add it to the root directory
of your project, commit and push. This file contains your CloudBees
credentials, but in an encrypted format. Nobody can read it, except the
Rultor server.

## Configure Versions Plugin

I recommend using [jcabi-parent]({% pst 2015/feb/2015-02-05-jcabi-parent-maven-pom %}).
It configures the required plugin out-of-the-box.
If you're using it, skip this step.

Otherwise, add this plugin to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<project>
  [..]
  <build>
    [..]
    <plugins>
      [..]
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
        <artifactId>versions-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>2.1</version>
        <configuration>
          <generateBackupPoms>false</generateBackupPoms>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>
```

## Configure Rultor

Create a `.rultor.yml` file in the root directory of your project
(this [reference page](https://doc.rultor.com/reference.html)
explains this format in detail):

```text
decrypt:
  settings.xml: "repo/settings.xml.asc"
release:
  script: |
    mvn versions:set "-DnewVersion=${tag}"
    git commit -am "${tag}"
    mvn clean deploy --settings /home/r/settings.xml
```

You can compare your file with live Rultor
[configuration of stateful.co](https://github.com/sttc/stateful/blob/master/.rultor.yml).

## Run It!

{% badge https://doc.rultor.com/images/logo.svg 100 https://www.rultor.com %}

Now it's time to see how it all works. Create a new ticket in the
GitHub issue tracker, and post something like that into it
(read more about [Rultor commands](https://doc.rultor.com/basics.html)):

```text
@rultor release, tag is `0.1`
```

You will get a response in a few seconds. The rest will be done by Rultor.

Enjoy!

BTW, if something doesn't work as I've explained, don't hesitate to
submit a ticket to the
[Rultor issue tracker](https://github.com/yegor256/rultor/issues).
I will try to help you.

Also, a similar configuration can be performed
for [Heroku]({% pst 2014/sep/2014-09-13-deploying-to-heroku %})
(using [jcabi-heroku-maven-plugin](https://heroku.jcabi.com))
and for AWS Elastic Beanstalk (using [jcabi-beanstalk-maven-plugin](https://beanstalk.jcabi.com)).
I'll probably dedicate individual posts to them, as well.
