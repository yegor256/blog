D29 is a prototype of a new programming language and a development platform.
Well, actually, not a prototype yet, but just an idea. As it looks to me,
the languages we have now (even the most modern ones) are still close to COBOL/C
and far from being truly elegant and modern.

Would be great if we can design a [language]({% pst 2016/nov/2016-11-29-eolang %})/platform, which will be
a mix of object oriented programming and functional programming, and will
have all the features listed below, out-of-the-box.

Key principles:

 * everything is an object
 * `byte` and `bytes` are the only built-in types
 * strict compile-time static analysis

Maybe native support of:

Features:

 * no mutable objects ([why?]({% pst 2014/jun/2014-06-09-objects-should-be-immutable %}))
 * no public/protected object properties

 * no operator overloading
 * all methods are either final or abstract
 * no mutability of method arguments
 * no [mocking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object) ([why?]({% pst 2014/sep/2014-09-23-built-in-fake-objects %}))
 * no [reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_%28computer_programming%29)
 * no `instanceof` operator ([why?]({% pst 2015/apr/2015-04-02-class-casting-is-anti-pattern %}))
 * no root class (like, for example, `Object` in Java)
 * instant object destruction instead of garbage collection

Maybe:

 * native support of Java classes/libraries
 * compilation into Java byte code

If interested to contribute, email me. Maybe we'll do something together.

Update: We created it, it's called [EOLANG](https://www.eolang.org).
