  Since many managers may not have the expertise to assess our technical work, 
  the best strategy for seeming a top performer is to be visible to your manager often.

According to a [study](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/09534810710760045/full/html) 
conducted by [Dariusz Jemielniak](https://www.jemielniak.org/) in 2007, the majority of programmers perceive 
their own managers as highly incompetent. We don't expect our bosses to be 
coding-savvy---this level of technical competence is [not a requirement]({% pst 2016/may/2016-05-24-who-is-project-manager %})
for an average manager. Additionally, we don't expect them to excel in 
Gantt Chart wizardry or adhere strictly to 
[risk management protocols]({% pst 2019/may/2019-05-14-cause-risk-effect %})---these 
are management practices that are not commonly observed in software teams today.
Instead, what we do expect from them is the ability to gauge our productivity: 
recognizing and rewarding the best performers while 
[taking action]({% pst 2015/sep/2015-09-16-how-to-fire-someone-right %}) against those who are less motivated. 
Unfortunately, this is a management competence that they lack... or perhaps, 
[fortunately]({% pst 2021/mar/2021-03-03-imposters-to-win %}).

I believe that the ability to measure results objectively is what makes a competent manager. The
recent desire of large tech companies to restrict and/or entirely prohibit remote work has
highlighted the lack of this ability in the industry. Indeed, a manager who knows how to evaluate
the work of the team and its individual members wouldn't worry about whether they are co-located in
an office or working remotely. It simply [wouldn't matter]({% pst 2017/may/2017-05-02-remote-slaves %})! 
If programmers know that [rewards]({% pst 2014/sep/2014-09-24-why-monetary-awards-dont-work %}) will be
given for deliverables and that penalties will occur in their absence, they can find the best place
to create these deliverables, be it at home, in the office, or at a coffee shop (I'm one of them).
However, if programmers don't have such a straightforward 
"[reward and punishment]({% pst 2018/oct/2018-10-09-can-you-control-us %})" system, they can
become lazy and demotivated. To get back on track, they need a manager, an office, and daily
[supervision]({% pst 2015/jul/2015-07-21-hourly-pay-modern-slavery %}).

Google recently [said](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/08/google-to-crack-down-on-hybrid-work-asks-remote-workers-to-reconsider.html)
that "working together in the same room makes a positive difference"...
for Google's <del>incompetent</del> managers, I guess. 
They may judge productivity by the amount of time their coders spend staring at monitors. 
They don't need to concern themselves with establishing an objective performance evaluation system. 
They don't need to count the [lines of code]({% pst 2014/apr/2014-04-11-cost-of-loc %}) 
(it's [nonsense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zen0B0SNwI), because Bill Gates said so!). 
They don't need to break down the scope into tasks and then assess their complexity 
(that's unfeasible, since we programmers are [artists]({% pst 2016/sep/2016-09-27-command-control-innovate %})!). 
They don't need to risk damaging 
[morale]({% pst 2015/mar/2015-03-02-team-morale-myths-and-reality %}) 
and creativity by introducing the concept of [productivity evaluation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZcNHZ_FJco) 
(that's unthinkable!). 
They can simply reward the most disciplined clock-watchers and call it a management.

On the other hand, perhaps it's not entirely detrimental for some of us. If the management 
is [incompetent]({% pst 2017/aug/2017-08-01-how-to-manage-a-manager %}) 
enough to "make office attendance part of performance reviews" 
(as [Google just has](https://arstechnica.com/google/2023/06/google-makes-office-attendance-part-of-performance-reviews/)), 
let's play along and provide them with what they want: let's attend! 
Let's display our [loyalty]({% pst 2015/oct/2015-10-06-how-to-be-good-office-slave %}), 
engagement, and [enthusiasm](https://www.yegor256.com/pdf/2019/enthusiasm.pdf), 
rather than our [lines of code]({% pst 2014/nov/2014-11-14-hits-of-code %}) 
and [pull requests]({% pst 2018/jul/2018-07-24-bugs-or-pull-requests %}). 
Let's focus on fitting into the group rather than contributing to the codebase.

Woody Allen [once remarked](https://www.creativelive.com/blog/the-importance-of-showing-up/) that "80 percent of success
is showing up." I would propose that we repurpose this as career advice for us programmers: Just Show Up. This mantra
applies not only to office attendance, but can also be applied to many other activities throughout your 
[career development]({% pst 2017/jan/2017-01-24-career-advice %}). 
You should be where your boss(es) can physically see you. No, not your work---that's immaterial. They need
to see you in person. Here's what you can do to truly "Just Show Up":

  - Participate in all [meetings]({% pst 2015/jul/2015-07-13-meetings-are-legalized-robbery %}), events, workshops, and team-building activities;
  - Situate yourself next to the boss;
  - Become a member of all committees;
  - Seize every opportunity to [ask questions]({% pst 2020/dec/2020-12-29-metric-for-emotions %});
  - Be vocal in the office to ensure that your boss hears you;
  - Submit proposals whenever they're requested;
  - Respond to all emails;
  - Upvote every chat message.

This strategy might not necessarily make you a better programmer, 
but it will certainly [convince]({% pst 2016/jan/2016-01-05-how-to-punish-employees %}) 
your boss that you are one.
