[Method overloading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_overloading)
is a common feature in many programming languages that allows
a class to have two or more methods with the same name but different parameters.
[According](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/member-overloading)
to Microsoft, method overloading is "one of the most important techniques
for _improving_ usability, productivity, and readability of reusable libraries."
I disagree. In my opinion, method overloading may lead to less readable code and more bugs,
because maintaining two or more implementations under the same name gives rise to
concealed semantics, which inevitably result in misunderstandings and functional defects.

Let's start with a Java example.
Suppose you wish to enable the addition of a product to the shopping cart,
having either the product ID or the `Product` object at your disposal.
If only the ID is provided, you'd want the shopping cart to access
the product catalog, locate the corresponding `Product` object, and add it.
This is where method overloading can prove beneficial (the `add()` method is
defined twice with two different [signatures](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8516498)
and implementations):

```java
class Cart {
  private final List<Product> products;
  void add(int id) {
    this.add(new Catalog().findById(id));
  }
  void add(Product p) {
    this.products.add(p);
  }
}
var c = new Cart();
c.add(new Product("book"));
c.add(42);
```

This approach is indeed convenient for at least two reasons. First, the
`add(int)` method handles the conversion from `int` to `Product`,
which need not be repeated elsewhere---they can simply pass the product's ID
to this method and let it do the work---thereby eliminating code duplication.
Second, because the functionality of "searching the catalog" is not exposed
beyond the `Cart` class, it simplifies the surrounding code. It appears that,
indeed, the usability and readability of the code are enhanced.

However, the issues addressed (code duplication and complexity) are lesser
than the problems introduced. While the semantics of the `add(Product)` method are
obvious, the workings of the `add(int)` method are not clear to its users.
Perhaps it searches the catalog? Maybe it selects the n-th product from
the existing cart and re-adds it to the end of the cart? Or perhaps it searches
the orders previously placed by the user and extracts the n-th product from there?
We simply don't know when we examine the method's signature.

{% quote When something is obscured, it prompts assumptions, which in turn lead to misunderstandings, and eventually to bugs. %}

In order to comprehend what the `add(int)` method does, we must refer to
its Javadoc block, which may not be sufficiently accurate. Furthermore,
[as is often the case](https://stackoverflow.com/a/913342/187141),
the documentation in the Javadoc block might not be
in sync with the code inside the method. To put it plainly, the client
using the `add(int)` method invariably makes an assumption about its inner workings.
If the client is fortunate,
1)&nbsp;the assumption will be accurate, and
2)&nbsp;any changes subsequently made to the method won't invalidate that assumption.

It appears that method overloading is the root of the issue: maintaining
multiple implementations under a single name inevitably introduces some
concealed semantics in most of them. Then, when something is obscured, it prompts
assumptions, which in turn lead to misunderstandings, and eventually to bugs.

I believe, a better alternative looks like this:

```java
class ProductInCatalog implements Product {
  private final Product p;
  ProductInCatalog(int id) {
    this.p = new Catalog().findById(id);
  }
  // all "Product" interface's methods
}
class Cart {
  private final List<Product> products;
  void add(Product p) {
    this.products.add(p);
  }
}
var c = new Cart();
c.add(new Product("book"));
c.add(new ProductInCatalog(42));
```

The constructor of `ProductInCatalog` is not code-free,
as [it ideally should be]({% pst 2015/may/2015-05-07-ctors-must-be-code-free %}),
however, this point is not so significant for our current discussion. The `ProductInCatalog`
class serves as an abstraction of a `Product` found in the catalog. This class
is used by the client of the `Cart` class. The client, in full
awareness and with explicit intent, converts 42 (the product's ID) into an instance
of `ProductInCatalog`. This design no longer conceals any elements. There are
no assumptions to be made and no conditions that the code must fulfill.

Do we still preserve the advantages provided by method overloading? Indeed, we do.
There is no code duplication, and the complexity of the code is reduced.
Furthermore, the readability of the code using the `Cart` is significantly improved.
To summarize, I recommend avoiding method overloading, even though it will undoubtedly
result in a larger number of classes in the codebase. However, that is
[a different discussion altogether]({% pst 2017/feb/2017-02-28-too-many-classes %}).
