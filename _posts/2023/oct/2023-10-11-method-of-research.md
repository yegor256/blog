Every empirical research paper must have a section titled "Method" (or "Methodology," or "Study Design"). In this section, you describe what was done to obtain the data presented in the following "Results" section. You explain the _recipe_, which may be replicated later by another researcher, leading to the same (or very similar) results.

The Method section is the essence of the research. Think of it as a recipe: you
tell the reader what ingredients you used, how you mixed them, and---most
importantly---why.

You start the section with a paragraph where you state the main _objective_ of the
research, then break it down into a few 
[_research questions_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_question).

Then, you explain, paragraph by paragraph, the _procedures_ of the method. In each
step, you either collect, combine, or generate data. First, you explain what
you do. Second, you highlight how your procedures contribute to one of the
research questions. Third, you justify your actions by providing strong enough
reasons for why you performed these specific manipulations with the data.

Here is a toy sample of the Method section:

``` 
The goal of this study is to understand whether 
cats love fruits. This leads to the following 
research questions: 
  RQ1: How is the color of a cat's fur related 
  to the cat's passion for fruits? 
  RQ2: Which fruits are preferred by cats: 
  bananas, apples, or marakujas?

First, we found 15 cats: 2 white, 3 black, 
and 10 of mixed color. It is important for RQ1 
that they are of different colors. We believe 
that 15 is enough because this is a toy research.

Second, we excluded 5 cats: those who were 
younger than one year old or older than 8 years 
old. This was motivated by RQ2; we believe that 
young and old cats may have difficulty cracking 
the hard cover of a marakuja.

Third, we gave our cats all three fruits mentioned 
in RQ2, left them for an hour, and observed their 
behavior. We believe one hour is enough for a hungry
cat to make a decision.

All cat owners agreed to have their cats 
participate in the study. 
```

At the end of the section, we mentioned that all participants in the experiment
provided informed consent—this is important if humans (or cats) are involved,
so don't forget about it.

In the "Results" section, which follows the Method, you present the data that
were collected, combined, or generated (without giving any opinion or
subjective interpretation of it!). Some of this data may have already been
mentioned in the Method section, but not the most important details. For
example, we've already said that we found 15 cats, but we didn't provide their
names, ages, or breeds---this information goes into the Results, in the form of
a nicely formatted table. How much "results" to show in the Method and how much
in the Results is, I believe, a matter of taste.

In the "Discussion" section, which follows the Results, you engage in a dialogue
with yourself, questioning the procedures of the Method. This is where
you are allowed to have an opinion about the data collected, combined, and
generated. For example, we may discuss whether the results of our research
are trustworthy enough, taking into account that we only analyzed the behavior
of just 15 cats, while in the Method, we were absolutely sure that we were doing
the right thing. In the Discussion, you play the opposite role by doubting
every single step of the Method, highlighting its weaknesses and limitations.
