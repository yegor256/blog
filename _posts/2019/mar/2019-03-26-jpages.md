How do you design a web application in Java? You install Spring, read
the manual, create [controllers]({% pst 2015/mar/2015-03-09-objects-end-with-er %}),
create some views, add some [annotations]({% pst 2016/apr/2016-04-12-java-annotations-are-evil %}), and it
works. What would you do if there were no
[Spring](https://spring.io/) (and no Ruby on Rails
in Ruby, and no Symphony in PHP, and no ... etc.)? Let's try to create
a web application from scratch, starting from a pure Java SDK and ending
with a fully functional web app, covered by unit tests. I recorded
a [webinar no.42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVzEPOZ_mDU)
about it just a few weeks ago, but this article should explain it
all in even more detail.

First of all we have to create an HTTP server, which will open a
server socket, listen to incoming connections, read everything they
have to say (HTTP requests) and return the information any
web browser would like (HTTP responses). You know how
[HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) works, right?
If you don't, here is a quick reminder:

A web browser sends a request to the server and the request looks
like this (it's a plain text piece of data):

```text
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
```

The server has to read this text, prepare the answer (which has to be the
HTML page readable by the browser) and return it like this:

```text
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: 26

<html>Hello, world!</html>
```

That's it. It's a very simple and, I would say, primitive protocol. The implementation
of a web server in Java is not so complex either. Here it is, in a very
simplistic form:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;
import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.net.ServerSocket;
import java.net.Socket;
import java.net.SocketTimeoutException;
import java.util.Arrays;
public class Main {
  public static void main(String... argv) {
    try (ServerSocket server = new ServerSocket(8080)) {
      server.setSoTimeout(1000);
      while (true) {
        try (Socket socket = server.accept()) {
          try (InputStream input = socket.getInputStream();
            OutputStream output = socket.getOutputStream()) {
            byte[] buffer = new byte[10000];
            int total = input.read(buffer);
            String request = new String(Arrays.copyOfRange(buffer, 0, total));
            String response = "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n\r\nHello, world!";
            output.write(response.getBytes());
          }
        } catch (SocketTimeoutException ex) {
          if (Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) {
              break;
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Try to run it, it should work. You should be able to open the `http://localhost:8080`
page in your browser and see the `Hello, world!` text.

It's not yet a web app, but just a skeleton, which does simple dispatching
of HTTP requests into HTTP responses. There is no serious OOP
in it though. It's pretty procedural, but it works. Now we should focus
on a more important question: How do we add more features to the web app
and make it possible to process different pages, render larger content,
and handle errors? The `request` variable in the snippet above
should be somehow converted to a `response`.

{% youtube bVzEPOZ_mDU %}

The easiest way would be 1) to convert the request into a [DTO]({% pst 2016/jul/2016-07-06-data-transfer-object %})
with all the details inside, then 2) send it to a "controller" that knows what to
do with the data from the DTO, and then 3) receive a response DTO from
the controller, take the data out and render the response. This is how
Spring and ~~most~~ all other frameworks do it. However, we won't follow this
path, we will try to do it DTO-free and [purely]({% pst 2014/nov/2014-11-20-seven-virtues-of-good-object %})
object-oriented.

I have to say that there could be multiple designs, all in an OOP style. I'll
show you now only one of those options. You're no doubt aware of
our [Takes](https://www.takes.org) framework, which
was born a few years ago---it has its own design, also object-oriented. But the
one I'm going to suggest now seems to be better. You might come up
with something else too, so don't hesitate to post your ideas in the comments
below or even create a GitHub repo and share your thoughts right there.

{% youtube YXqHaZJD9R8 %}

I suggest we introduce two interfaces: `Resource` and `Output`. The `Resource`
is the server side entity, which mutates depending on the request parameters
that are coming in. For example, when all we know about the request is that
it is `GET /`, it is one resource. But if we also know that the
request has, for example, `Accept: text/plain`, we can mutate the request
and create a new one, which delivers plain text. Here is the interface:

```java
interface Resource {
  Resource refine(String name, String value);
}
```

Here is how we create it and mutate:

```java
Resource r = new DefaultResource()
  .refine("X-Method", "GET")
  .refine("X-Query", "/")
  .refine("Accept", "text/plain");
```

Pay attention: each call to `.refine()` returns a new instance
of interface `Resource`. All of them are immutable, just like objects
[have to be]({% pst 2014/jun/2014-06-09-objects-should-be-immutable %}).
Thanks to this design we don't separate [data]({% pst 2016/nov/2016-11-21-naked-data %})
from their processor. The resource is the data and the processor. Each resource
knows what to do with the data, and receives only the data it is supposed
to receive. Technically, we just implement _request dispatching_, but in
an object-oriented way.

Then, we need to convert the resource to the response. We give the
resource the ability to render itself to the response. We don't want the
[data]({% pst 2016/nov/2016-11-21-naked-data %}), in form of some DTO,
to escape the resource. We want the resource
[to print]({% pst 2016/apr/2016-04-05-printers-instead-of-getters %}) the
response. How about giving an additional method `print()` to the resource:

```java
interface Resource {
  Resource refine(String name, String value);
  void print(Output output);
}
```

And then the interface `Output` looks like this:

```java
interface Output {
  void print(String name, String value);
}
```

Here is a primitive implementation of `Output`:

```java
public class StringBuilderOutput implements Output {
  private final StringBuilder buffer;
  StringBuilderOutput(StringBuilder buf) {
    this.buffer = buf;
  }
  @Override
  public void print(String name, String value) {
    if (this.buffer.length() == 0) {
      this.buffer.append("HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n");
    }
    if (name.equals("X-Body")) {
      this.buffer.append("\r\n").append(value);
    } else {
      this.buffer.append(name).append(": ").append(value).append("\r\n");
    }
  }
}
```

To build an HTTP response we can do this:

```java
StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();
Output output = new StringBuilderOutput(builder);
output.print("Content-Type", "text/plain");
output.print("Content-Length", "13");
output.print("X-Body", "Hello, world!");
System.out.println(builder.toString());
```

Now let's create a class which will take an incoming request `String`
and produce a response `String`, using an instance of `Resource` as a
_dispatcher_:

```java
public class Session {
  private final Resource resource;
  Session(Resource res) {
    this.resource = res;
  }
  String response(String request) throws IOException {
    Map<String, String> pairs = new HashMap<>();
    String[] lines = request.split("\r\n");
    for (int idx = 1; idx < lines.length; ++idx) {
      String[] parts = lines[idx].split(":");
      pairs.put(parts[0].trim(), parts[1].trim());
      if (lines[idx].empty()) {
        break;
      }
    }
    String[] parts = lines[0].split(" ");
    pairs.put("X-Method", parts[0]);
    pairs.put("X-Query", parts[1]);
    pairs.put("X-Protocol", parts[2]);
    App.Resource res = this.resource;
    for (Map.Entry<String, String> pair : pairs.entrySet()) {
      res = res.refine(pair.getKey(), pair.getValue());
    }
    StringBuilder buf = new StringBuilder();
    res.print(new StringBuilderOutput(buf));
    return buf.toString();
  }
}
```

First, we parse the request, breaking its header into lines and ignoring
the body of the request. You can modify the code to parse the body
and pass it into the `refine()` method too, using `X-Body` as the key. At
the moment, the code above doesn't do that. But you get the idea. The parsing
part of the snippet prepares the pairs it can find in the request and passes them one by one
to the encapsulated resource, mutating it until it gets to the final form.
A simple resource that always returns text might look like this:

```java
class TextResource implements Resource {
  private final String body;
  public TextResource(String text) {
    this.body = text;
  }
  @Override
  public Resource refine(String name, String value) {
    return this;
  }
  @Override
  public void print(Output output) {
    output.print("Content-Type", "text/plain");
    output.print("Content-Length", Integer.toString(this.body.length()));
    output.print("X-Body", this.body);
  }
}
```

A resource that pays attention to the query string and dispatches
the request to other resources, depending on the path in the query,
might look like this:

```java
new Resource() {
  @Override
  public Resource refine(String name, String value) {
    if (name.equals("X-Query")) {
      if (value.equals("/")) {
        return new TextResource("Hello, world!");
      } else if (value.equals("/balance")) {
        return new TextResource("256");
      } else if (value.equals("/id")) {
        return new TextResource("yegor");
      } else {
        return new TextResource("Not found!");
      }
    } else {
      return this;
    }
  }
  @Override
  public void print(final Output output) {
    throws IllegalStateException("This shouldn't happen");
  }
}
```

I hope you got the idea. The code above is rather sketchy, and the majority
of use cases are not implemented, but you can do that yourself, if you are
interested. The code is in the [yegor256/jpages](https://github.com/yegor256/jpages)
repository. Don't hesitate to contribute with a pull request and make this
small framework real.
