  Prestructor is a private static method or a stand-alone
  class that is used in constructors of other objects
  to pre-process their arguments.

Making constructors pre-process the arguments before
encapsulating them seems to be
[bad practice]({% pst 2015/may/2015-05-07-ctors-must-be-code-free %}).
However, very often it's necessary to do exactly that: perform some manipulations
with the objects provided as arguments and only then assign
them to the attributes of the constructed object. For this purpose
I suggest using prestructors, which could be methods or stand-alone
objects.

Say, this is your code:

```java
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Collections;
class Books {
  private final List<String> titles;
  Books(List<String> list) {
    this.titles = Collections.unmodifiableList(list);
  }
}
```

The only constructor expects a list of titles, which is being
encapsulated as `this.titles` for some future use. It's also protected against
any accidental modifications, through the JDK decorator at
[`unmodifiableList`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Collections.html#unmodifiableList-java.util.List-).
So far, so good. Now, we want to make our class a bit smarter
and let it accept not only the `List` but an array of strings:

```java
class Books {
  private List<String> titles;
  Books(List<String> list) {
    this.titles = Collections.unmodifiableList(list);
  }
  Books(String... array) {
    final List<String> list = new ArrayList<>(array.length);
    for (final String title : array) {
      list.add(title);
    }
    this.titles = list;
  }
}
```

What's wrong with this code? Those of you who have read my earlier
[blog posts about OOP](/tag/oop.html) most definitely know the answer. First,
there are two primary constructors, which is another
[bad practice]({% pst 2015/may/2015-05-28-one-primary-constructor %}).
Second, there is code in the second constructor, which is also a
[bad idea]({% pst 2015/may/2015-05-07-ctors-must-be-code-free %}).

Here is how I usually refactor this code, to solve both mentioned problems:

```java
class Books {
  private List<String> titles;
  Books(List<String> list) {
    this.titles = Collections.unmodifiableList(list);
  }
  Books(String... array) {
    this(Books.toList(array));
  }
  private static List<String> toList(String... array) {
    final List<String> list = new ArrayList<>(array.length);
    for (final String title : array) {
      list.add(title);
    }
    return list;
  }
}
```

I call this new static method `toList()` a _prestructor_: it is used
only at the moment of object construction and only from the
secondary constructor.

An even better way to design it would be to make a new class `ToList`,
which would do exactly the same, but in a more declarative and lazy way:

```java
class Books {
  private List<String> titles;
  Books(List<String> list) {
    this.titles = Collections.unmodifiableList(list);
  }
  Books(String... array) {
    this(new ToList(array));
  }
}
class ToList<T> implements List<T> {
  private final T[] array;
  ToList(T... items) {
    this.array = items;
  }
  // All required methods of the List interface
}
```

[`ListOf`](https://www.javadoc.io/static/org.cactoos/cactoos/0.50/org/cactoos/list/ListOf.html)
from [Cactoos](https://www.cactoos.org) is a perfect example
of such a prestructor.
