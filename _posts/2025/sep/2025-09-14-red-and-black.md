In Soviet Russia, prisoner camps were divided into two categories: red and black.
In a red camp, the power belonged to the prisoners who cooperated with the administration and helped it maintain discipline.
In a black one, the power was in the hands of criminals who resented the rules, in permanent confrontation with the administration.
It seems that in software companies we may also categorize employees into red and black.
A **red employee** enjoys obeying the rules and climbs up the career ladder by [making the boss happy]({% pst 2015/jan/2015-01-26-happy-boss-false-objective %}).
To the contrary, a **black employee**, while understanding the inevitability, despises the necessity to obey.
Their career growth is driven by [making the customer happy]({% pst 2015/feb/2015-02-23-haircut %}).
Which one are you?

An organization cannot exist without policies and regulations.
Especially if it's a large organization where the percentage of underperformers is highest.
The clock-watchers must be disciplined so that they produce at least something.
Let's assume you are not one of them.

However, even if you are not a nine-to-five clock-watcher, you can't ignore the policies.
A few examples of the rules you may need to obey:

* All reports must follow the official PowerPoint template
* Every meeting requires written minutes sent to all participants
* Job candidates must pass through the full HR pipeline
* Employees must re-certify their skills on a fixed schedule

All of the above seem reasonable---just like prison rules.
The difference is your attitude toward them.

They are either a framework for your career or an inevitable evil.
You either feel happy when you do what's required, or feel annoyed and do it just because it's required.
You either fill out all the forms completely, or you cut every possible corner to get back to the real work.
You either read an email copied to 25 people to not miss anything or immediately delete it.
You either attend all meetings or learn to be creative in finding reasons why you can't.

You are either red or black.
Once you find your **identity**, you start despising the other side.

If you are red, you don't understand the black employees who are constantly rebelling.
They rebel against the rules you so much enjoy following.
You see them as dishonest, disloyal, and selfish sociopaths.

If you are black, you despise the red employees who are trying so hard to associate themselves with the system.
They study the rules and compete against each other---who knows them better.
You see them as [shallow]({% pst 2017/aug/2017-02-22-to-be-nice-or-not %}) and incompetent [impostors]({% pst 2021/mar/2021-03-03-imposters-to-win %}).

Peace is not possible.
In any large organization, reds will always dominate---it's inevitable.
The system needs them, and they thrive inside it.
Blacks will always be a minority, surviving at the edges.

If you are black, don't waste energy trying to convert or fight the reds.
You won't win.
The only strategy is distance.
Minimize contact, keep your head down when necessary, and focus on delivering real value where it matters.
Reds will spend their lives climbing the corporate ladder.
Blacks must learn to survive in the shadows of that ladder, working for the customer, not the boss.
