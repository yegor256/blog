In Soviet Russia, prisoner camps were divided into two categories: red and black.
In a red camp, the power belonged to the prisoners who cooperated with the administration and helped it maintain discipline.
In a black one, the power was in the hands of those criminals who resented the rules, in permanent confrontation with the administration.
It seems that in software companies we may also categorize employees into red and black.
A "red" employee enjoys obeying the rules and climbs up the career ladder by making the boss happy.
To the contrary, a "black" employee, while understanding the inevitability, despises the necessity to obey.
His career growth is driven by making the customer happy.
Which one are you?

An organization cannot exist without policies and regulations.
Especially if it's a large organization where the percentage of underperformers is the highest.
The clock-watchers must be disciplined so that they produce at least something.
Let's assume you are not one of them.

However, even if you are not a nine-to-five clock-watcher, you can't ignore the policies.
A few examples of the rules you may need to obey:

* Project plans must be in PowerPoint, the template is mandatory
* Everybody must check-in the attendance tracking system
* Annual plans must be written using MS Word template
* Job candidates must go through all mandatory HR steps
* Every meeting must have minutes emailed to everybody
* Employees must semi-annually certify their qualification

All of the above are reasonable.
Just like all the regulations in a prison.
The difference is your attitude to them.

They are either a framework for your career or an inevitable evil.
You either feel happy when you do what's required, or feel annoyed and do it just because it's required.
You either fill out all the forms completely, or you cut every possible corner to get back to the real work.
You either read an email copied to 25 people to not miss a thing or immediately delete it.
You either attend all meetings or learn to be creative in finding reasons why you can't.

Once you find your identity---either red or black---you start despising the other side.

If you are red, you don't understand the black employees who are constantly rebelling.
They rebel against the rules you so much enjoy following.
You see them as dishonest, disloyal, and selfish sociopaths.

If you are black, you despise the red employees who are trying so hard to associate themselves with the system.
They study the rules and compete against each other---who knows them better.
You see them as shallow and incompetent impostors.

Peace is not possible.
Just choose your side.
Guess mine.
