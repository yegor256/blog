In Soviet Russia, prisoner camps were divided to two categories: red and black.
In a red camp, the power belonged to the prisoners who cooperated with the administration and respected the rules.
In a black one, the power was in the hands of those criminals who resented the rules.
In modern organizations we may also categorize employees into red and black.
A "red" employee enjoys obeying the rules and climbs up the carreer ladder by being a good sport.
To the contrary, a "black" employee, while understands the inevitability, despises the necessity to obey.
His career growth is driven by the value of the product he produces.
Which one are you?
