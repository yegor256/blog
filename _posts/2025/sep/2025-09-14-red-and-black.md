In Soviet Russia, prisoner camps were divided to two categories: red and black.
In a red camp, the power belongs to the prisoners who cooperate with the administration and respect the rules.
In a black one, the power is in the hands of those criminals who resent the rules.
The same happens in any modern organization.
All employees may be divided into two categories: red an black.
Which one are you?
