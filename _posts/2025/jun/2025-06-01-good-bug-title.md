  ChatGPT helps us re-format GitHub issue titles
  after their authors submit them --- helping developers
  understand their tasks better.
keywords:
  - bug report title
  - bug title

A few weeks ago, [@horw] released a new GitHub plugin that fixes GitHub issue titles: [issue-title-ai].
Once an issue is created, the plugin asks [ChatGPT]---or [DeepSeek], or [Claude]---to improve its title.
We've already integrated the plugin into [objectionary/eo] and a few other repositories.
Works like a charm.
What's wrong with the titles the way they are, you may ask?
Why do we need to ask ChatGPT to make them "better"?
We want every issue---either a bug report, a feature request, or a question---to be formulated as a [complaint]{% pst 2025/may/2025-05-25-bug-driven-development %}.
It seems that very few of us can do it on the first try.
The help of AI is appreciated.

Let's say, you try to download a PNG file, but get a text file instead.
You want to report this problem to the team.
How would you title such a bug report?
Pick one, out of these five:

* "CSV file downloading"
* "Fix CSV-file downloading"
* "CSV downloading must be fixed"
* "Why I get text file instead of PNG?"
* "I need text file, not PNG"
* "PNG file downloading is broken"

There may be more... While the best is the last one.
It explicitly states that something is broken.
It demands a fix.

We believe that every ticket must be a bug report.
We---and [Mozilla]---call it [bug-driven development]{% pst 2025/may/2025-05-25-bug-driven-development %}.
Even if it's a feature request or a question, it must be filed as a complaint.
