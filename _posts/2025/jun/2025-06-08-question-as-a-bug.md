Imagine, you join a new repository as a contributor.
The repository is a mess---just like most of them are.
You can't figure out where to put new files and why a particular integration test doesn't run.
You don't understand their design.
You drink more coffee and curse the day when you became a programmer.
You study the project with a hope to get through it eventually.
And you will, eventually.
But there is a faster and more effective way.

Actually, what offen happens is not the symptoms I just described.
Most coders, especially the youngest, don't study the project.
They pull the code, make the changes, make a branch, and submit a pull request.
They don't even try to build locally.

Then, when they see that CI jobs don't pass in their pull request, they post a message right there in the PR:
"I don't understand why it fails".
