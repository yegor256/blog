This is the forth year of the
[Software Quality Award](/award.html). The prize
is still the same---**$4,096**.
The rules are still the same. Read on.
Previous years are here:
[2015]({% pst 2015/apr/2015-04-16-award %}),
[2016]({% pst 2015/oct/2015-10-17-award-2016 %}),
[2017]({% pst 2016/oct/2016-10-23-award-2017 %}).

<!--more-->

Rules:

  * One person can submit only one project.

  * Submissions are accepted until September 1, 2018.

  * I will check the commit history to make sure you're the main contributor to the project.

  * I reserve the right to reject any submission without explanation.

  * All submissions will be published on this page (including rejected ones).

  * Results will be announced October 15, 2018 on this page and by email.

  * The best project will receive $4,096 (I may split this amount among a few projects).

  * Final decisions will be made by me and are not negotiable
    (although I may invite other people to help me make the right decision).

  * Winners that received any cash prizes in previous years can't submit again.

Each project must be:

  * Open source (in GitHub).

  * At least 10,000 lines of code ([`cloc`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cloc) without any arguments).

  * At least one year old.

  * Object-oriented (that's the only thing I understand).

The best project is selected using this [criteria]({% pst 2015/jun/2015-06-08-deadly-sins-software-project %}).

What doesn't matter:

  * Popularity. Even if nobody is using your
    product, it is still eligible for this award. I don't care about
    popularity; quality is the key.

  * Programming language. I believe that any language, used correctly,
    can be applied to design a high-quality product.

  * Buzz and trends. Even if your project is yet another parser of command
    line arguments, it's still eligible for the award. I don't care about
    your marketing position; quality is all.

By the way, if you want to sponsor this award and increase the bonus,

This is the summary of everything they sent me:
[award-2018.txt](/txt/2018/award-2018.txt). I will pick the winner in
the next few days, stay tuned!

This time I paid a lot of attention to what reviewers were saying. Obvious
show stoppers for me where:

  * Absence of CI
  * Absence of releases
  * Absence of issues and pull requests
  * Absence of static analysis
  * Absence of unit tests and/or coverage control
  * Presence of NULL
  * Presence of static methods and/or utility classes
  * Presence of global variables of functions

Because of that, many projects were ruled out (they are at the bottom of the
[text file](/txt/2018/award-2018.txt)). There are three sections in the text file.
The first one is the hot list, which I reviewed myself. The second one contains
those projects I liked, but decided not to put into the hot list.
The last section contains repositories, which seem to happen in the competition by mistake.

I have to say that this year the projects I see are much more disciplined
and organized, comparing to what I've seen in previous years. Is it the
achievement of this competition? I'm not sure, but I'm glad to see what I see.

This is my short-list:

 * [`pmed/v8pp`](https://github.com/pmed/v8pp) (C++, 5.6K LoC, 27K HoC): 6
 * [`shlinkio/shlink`](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink) (PHP, 12K LoC, 42K HoC): 6
 * [`FindMyFriends/api`](https://github.com/FindMyFriends/api) (PHP, 19K LoC, 152K HoC): 6
 * [`sql-boot/sql-boot`](https://github.com/sql-boot/sql-boot) (Java, 4.3K LoC, 110K HoC): 6
 * [`driver733/VK-Uploader`](https://github.com/driver733/VK-Uploader) (Java, 10.5 LoC, 37K HoC): 8
 * [`dgroup/docker-unittests`](https://github.com/dgroup/docker-unittests) (Java, 5.7K LoC, 38K HoC): 8
 * [`HDouss/jeometry`](https://github.com/HDouss/jeometry) (Java, 9.7K LoC, 28K HoC): 7
 * [`onqtam/doctest`](https://github.com/onqtam/doctest) (C++, 15K LoC, 113K HoC): 6
 * [`ribtoks/xpiks`](https://github.com/ribtoks/xpiks) (C++, 430K LoC, 965K HoC): 6
 * [`javascript-obfuscator/javascript-obfuscator`](https://github.com/javascript-obfuscator/javascript-obfuscator) (JavaScript, 80K LoC, 760K HoC): 6

Some projects in the list are indeed smaller than the required threshold
of 10K lines of code. However, their hits-of-code metrics are rather high
and the quality of code is high too, that's why I decided to keep them
in the list. Moreover, starting next year the threshold will be lowered down
to 4K LoC and 16K HoC. So, we have ten finalists. A more detailed review
of each of them you can find in the [text file](/txt/2018/award-2018.txt).

There are two winners this year. I decided to distribute $3K this year, unevenly
between them. [`@driver733`](https://github.com/driver733) gets $2K since
his project is obviously the best this year. [`@dgroup`](https://github.com/dgroup) gets
$1K since his project is smaller than the threshold, but it's still a good repo.

You may ask why I excluded some other small projects from the competition, but left
those few in the hot list. The answer is simple: I liked them and didn't like
the others. I do realize that the rules were supposed to be strict, but still.
Consider this $1K to [`@dgroup`](https://github.com/dgroup)---a cheering up bonus.

Thus, congratulations to
[`@driver733`](https://github.com/driver733) for [`VK-Uploader`](https://github.com/driver733/VK-Uploader) ($2,048)
and to
[`@dgroup`](https://github.com/dgroup) for [`docker-unittests`](https://github.com/dgroup/docker-unittests) ($1,024).
