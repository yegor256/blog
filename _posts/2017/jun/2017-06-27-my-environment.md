I was asked in my [Telegram Group](https://t.me/joinchat/AAAAAEJFMRzsRTRxM3ec6A)
which tools and hardware I use in my daily work. Here is the full list of
what I have and even how much I paid for them. Maybe it will be helpful
for someone.

<img src="/images/2017/06/env-macbook.jpg" class="env-ico" alt="icon"/><br/>
[MacBook M2 Pro](https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/)
16-inch, 32Gb/2Tb (~$4,000). My smartphone is iPhone&nbsp;14&nbsp;Max.
For video and podcast recording I'm using Zoom&nbsp;H1
together with
Cannon M50 and R10 cameras,
[Sennheiser HD 380 PRO](https://amzn.to/2ienJf9) headphones, and
[SLIK Sprint 150](https://amzn.to/2xy2ivL) tripod.

<img src="/images/2017/06/env-intellij-idea.jpg" class="env-ico" alt="icon"/><br/>
[IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) (~~$499~~ free)
for Java projects. I've got a free open source
license from [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/),
because I'm an active contributor and
an author of [Takes Framework](https://www.takes.org).
If you contribute to open source (and
[you must]({% pst 2015/dec/2015-12-22-why-dont-you-contribute-to-open-source %})), you may do
the same, I believe, just [email them](mailto:opensource@jetbrains.com) and ask.
These are my [`settings.jar`](/bin/settings.jar).

<img src="/images/2017/06/env-sublime-text.jpg" class="env-ico" alt="icon"/><br/>
[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) ($70)
for all texts I edit, including Ruby, JavaScript, and PHP code.
Also, for writing this blog
[in Markdown](https://github.com/yegor256/blog) and [my books](/books.html) in
[LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) Sublime is the
editor I use. I was using
[TextMate](https://macromates.com/) ($52) a few years ago, but switched
to Sublime because it's just better. I also tried
[Atom](https://atom.io/) (free) and didn't really like it.

<img src="/images/2017/06/env-chrome.jpg" class="env-ico" alt="icon"/><br/>
[Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/index.html) (free)
for web browsing. I also have
[Safari](https://www.apple.com/lae/safari/),
[FireFox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/),
and [Opera](https://www.opera.com/) but only to verify my websites
for cross-browser compatibility, that's all. I'm using these
plugins:
[AdBlock](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock/gighmmpiobklfepjocnamgkkbiglidom),
[Block site](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/block-site/eiimnmioipafcokbfikbljfdeojpcgbh?hl=en),
[Grammarly](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/grammarly-for-chrome/kbfnbcaeplbcioakkpcpgfkobkghlhen?hl=en),
[Rapportive](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rapportive/hihakjfhbmlmjdnnhegiciffjplmdhin?hl=en).

<img src="/images/2017/06/env-iterm2.jpg" class="env-ico" alt="icon"/><br/>
[iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) (free)
for the command line. It's a replacement of
[Terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_%28macOS%29), with
some nice features, which I'm not actually aware of.

<img src="/images/2017/06/env-homebrew.jpg" class="env-ico" alt="icon"/><br/>
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (free)
for package managing. Difficult to imagine Mac OSX without
Homebrew. I was using [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/)
in my previous MacBook, but switched to Homebrew and have no regrets.

<img src="/images/2017/06/env-yourkit.jpg" class="env-ico" alt="icon"/><br/>
[YourKit](https://www.yourkit.com/) (~~$499~~ free)
for Java profiling. I've got a free license from them, again because
I'm a contributor to a few open source projects.
[Email them](mailto:sales@yourkit.com)
if you want to get the same. As I
[tweeted](https://twitter.com/yegor256/status/875444908726730752) recently,
when I have to use YourKit, I know that I'm doing something very wrong
in my code.

<img src="/images/2017/06/env-httpclient.jpg" class="env-ico" alt="icon"/><br/>
[HTTP Client](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/http-client/id418138339?mt=12) ($2)
for HTTP requests/responses debugging, when
[`curl`](https://curl.haxx.se/) is not enough.

<img src="/images/2017/06/env-sketch.jpg" class="env-ico" alt="icon"/><br/>
[Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) ($99)
for editing vector graphics, mainly SVG. Also, it's good for
converting SVG into PNG.

<img src="/images/2017/06/env-pixelmator.jpg" class="env-ico" alt="icon"/><br/>
[Pixelmator](https://www.pixelmator.com/) ($30)
for editing rasterized images, like PNG, GIF, JPEG, etc.
The icons you see at this page were created with the help of
Pixelmator. It is a perfect alternative to
[Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html), if you
are a programmer, not a graphic designer.

<img src="/images/2017/06/env-1password.jpg" class="env-ico" alt="icon"/><br/>
[1Password](https://1password.com/) ($40)
for keeping all my passwords in one place. I don't know what I would
do without this tool. All my passwords, bank accounts, credit cards,
and passport scans are there.

<img src="/images/2017/06/env-zoom.jpg" class="env-ico" alt="icon"/><br/>
[Zoom](https://zoom.us/) ($150/year)
for conference calling and [Shift-M](/shift-m.html).

<img src="/images/2017/06/env-reaper.jpg" class="env-ico" alt="icon"/><br/>
[Reaper](http://reaper.fm/) ($60)
for post-processing of [Shift-M](/shift-m.html) episodes.

<img src="/images/2017/06/env-things.jpg" class="env-ico" alt="icon"/><br/>
[Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) ($50)
for long-term planning. I put my long-term plans there and open
them once a month. I definitely should use this software more frequently.

<!--
<img src="/images/2017/06/env-tower.jpg" class="env-ico" alt="icon"/><br/>
[Tower](https://www.git-tower.com/) ($79)
for visual [Git](https://git-scm.com/) manipulations. Even though I'm using Git
from the command line only, this tool helps me time to time when I need
to go through the history and find out where exactly I broke something.
-->

<img src="/images/2017/06/env-transmit.jpg" class="env-ico" alt="icon"/><br/>
[Transmit](https://panic.com/transmit/) ($34)
for FTP and AWS S3 file management.

<img src="/images/2017/06/env-obs.jpg" class="env-ico" alt="icon"/><br/>
[OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) (free)
for webinars and video recording.

<!--
<img src="/images/2017/06/env-mtorrent.jpg" class="env-ico" alt="icon"/><br/>
[ÂµTorrent](https://www.utorrent.com/) (free)
for stealing movies. I find them mostly at
[rutracker.org](http://rutracker.org/forum/index.php) or
[The Pirate Bay](https://piratebay.to/).
I do realize that stealing is a bad thing and I'm actually strongly
against piracy, but most movies are either too expensive or not
available for purchase.

<img src="/images/2017/06/env-vlc.jpg" class="env-ico" alt="icon"/><br/>
[VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html) (free)
for watching those stolen movies.

<img src="/images/2017/06/env-vienna.jpg" class="env-ico" alt="icon"/><br/>
[Vienna](https://www.vienna-rss.com/) (free)
for reading RSS feeds, rarely.

<img src="/images/2017/06/env-istat.jpg" class="env-ico" alt="icon"/><br/>
[iStat Menus](https://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/) ($18)
for OSX monitoring.

<img src="/images/2017/06/env-keynote.jpg" class="env-ico" alt="icon"/>
<img src="/images/2017/06/env-pages.jpg" class="env-ico" alt="icon"/>
<img src="/images/2017/06/env-numbers.jpg" class="env-ico" alt="icon"/><br/>
[Keynote](https://www.apple.com/lae/keynote/) for presentations,
[Pages](https://www.apple.com/lae/pages/) for documents sometimes,
and [Numbers](https://www.apple.com/lae/numbers/) for spreadsheets.
I don't remember me paying for them, but maybe I just forgot.

<img src="/images/2017/06/env-dropbox.jpg" class="env-ico" alt="icon"/>
<img src="/images/2017/06/env-icloud.jpg" class="env-ico" alt="icon"/>
<img src="/images/2017/06/env-google-drive.jpg" class="env-ico" alt="icon"/>
<img src="/images/2017/06/env-s3.jpg" class="env-ico" alt="icon"/><br/>
[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/personal) (free),
[iCloud](https://www.icloud.com/) ($1/mo),
and [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/) for storage.
I try to keep as little as possible on my laptop and upload
everything that is already "history" to my personal
[AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) bucket.

<img src="/images/2017/06/env-telegram.jpg" class="env-ico" alt="icon"/>

<img src="/images/2017/06/env-colloquy.jpg" class="env-ico" alt="icon"/><br/>
[Telegram](https://telegram.org/)

and
[WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/),
<!-- [Messenger](https://www.messenger.com/), -->

(all free, in order of preference)
for P2P messaging.
[Slack](https://slack.com/) for business messaging sometimes.
[Colloquy](http://colloquy.info/) for IRC messaging when I need it.

<img src="/images/2017/06/env-pokerstars.jpg" class="env-ico" alt="icon"/><br/>
[PokerStars](https://www.pokerstars.com/poker/download/?source=13953351) (not free at all)
for playing poker before falling asleep.
