Availability is a metric that demonstrates how often your website
is available to its users. Technically, it's a ratio between the number of successful
attempts to open the website and the number of failed ones. If one out of a hundred
attempts failed, we can say the availability is 99 percent. High-quality
websites aim for so-called "six nines"
[high availability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_availability), so named by the
number of 9s in the ratio: 99.9999 percent. We created a service that helps
you measure this metric and demonstrate its value to your users:
[SixNines](https://www.sixnines.io).

All you need to do is log in using your
[GitHub](https://www.github.com) account and register
your URI, which [SixNines](https://www.sixnines.io) will
validate. This operation will cost you
$4.95 (processed by [Stripe](https://www.stripe.com)).
It's a once-in-a-lifetime fee
(if you don't have any money, [email](mailto:free@sixnines.io) us and we'll figure something out).
As soon as your URI is in the system, we will monitor it
[forever](https://www.sixnines.io/terms).

The key problem with the availability metric is that it takes
_a lot_ of time in order to really guarantee a figure of "six nines."
Indeed, look at the ratio: 99.9999 percent means that only one attempt
out of a _million_ fails (provided we make them regularly with equal intervals).
In order to ping your website at least a million
times, we would have to work for 694 days and ping every minute. This
would take more than two years.

Only after those two years of 24-7 work would we be able to _prove_ that
your website is of "high availability" and the value of the metric
really is equal to 99.9999 percent (you would have all kinds of reasons to be proud of it).

As you see, their numbers are far from "six nines" because we just started
to measure them. In two years, we will see what their real availability is.
