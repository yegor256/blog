  them, and here's why.

I've been blogging and writing for almost three years now, and a few times a week
I get emails or Facebook and Telegram messages from
people I don't really know. They ask questions about Java,
management, object-oriented programming, and other things
they believe I understand and can help them with. Well, my contact details are
published right in the header on my blog---what else would I expect, right?
True, but even though I always reply to them, I never
answer their questions.

Why?

Because it's ineffective.

Honestly, I believe that the more people I help, the better. The bigger my contribution
to the community is, the better---for both the community and me personally.
That's why I try to answer every single comment on this blog,
on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/yegor256?sub_confirmation=1), in
our [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/yegor256/elegantobjects), and on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/yegor256).
I spend at least two hours a day on this activity.

That's why I'm asking everybody who seeks help from me personally to
go to one of these public channels and ask there. Then, I will find their
questions and answer them. Maybe even someone else will reply, because the community
is pretty big now.

When the question is asked publicly, _everybody_ can see our conversation
and learn something from it. This is the most effective use of my
time and the time of those who are asking.

Thus, you can expect **no help** provided privately, but all
public questions will be answered.
