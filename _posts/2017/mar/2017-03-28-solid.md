You definitely know the [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_%28object-oriented_design%29)
acronym. It stands for five principles of
[object-oriented programming]({% pst 2016/aug/2016-08-15-what-is-wrong-object-oriented-programming %})
that, if followed, are supposed to
make your code both [legible and extensible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_%28object-oriented_design%29).
They were introduced almost 30 years ago, but have they
really made us better programmers in the time since?
Do we really understand OOP better thanks to them? Do we write more
"legible and extensible" code? I don't think so.

{% jb_picture_body %}

Let's go one by one and see how they "help."

## S

The "S" refers to the [Single Responsibility Principle]({% pst 2017/dec/2017-12-19-srp-is-hoax %}),
which, according to [Clean Code](https://amzn.to/2m7LmaA) by
[Robert Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cecil_Martin), means that
"a class should have only one reason to change."

This statement sounds extremely vague to me, but the book explains it, stating that
objects must be problem-centered and responsible for "one thing."
It's up to us to decide what that _one thing_ is, of course.

This is what we know as
"[high cohesion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohesion_%28computer_science%29)"
since [Larry Constantine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Constantine)
wrote about it in the IBM Systems Journal in 1974.
Why was it necessary to create a new principle 15 years later with an ambiguous name and
a very questionable definition?

## O

This letter is about the [Open/Close Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open/closed_principle),
which was introduced by Bertrand Meyer in
[Object Oriented Software Construction](https://amzn.to/2lNxy44) in 1988.
Simply put, it means that an object should not be modifiable. I can't agree more
with this.

But then it says it should be _extendable_, literally through
[implementation inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_%28object-oriented_programming%29), which is
[known]({% pst 2016/sep/2016-09-13-inheritance-is-procedural %}) as an anti-OOP technology.
Thus, this principle is not really applicable to objects and OOP.
It may work with modules and services, but not with objects.

## L

The third letter is for the [Liskov Substitution Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle),
which was introduced by
[Barbara Liskov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Liskov) in 1987.
This one is the most innocent part in the SOLID pentad. In simple words, it states
that if your method expects a
[`Collection,`](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Collection.html)
an
[`ArrayList`](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html)
will work.

It is also known as [subtyping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtyping) and is
the foundational component of any object-oriented language. Why do we need to
call it a principle and "follow" it? Is it at all possible to create any
object-oriented software without subtyping? If this one is a principle, let's
add "variables" and "method calling" here too.

Honestly, I suspect that this principle was added to SOLID mostly in order
to somehow fill the gap between "SO" and "ID."

## I and D

I guess they both were introduced by
[Robert Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cecil_Martin) while
he was working at Xerox.

The [Interface Segregation Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_segregation_principle)
states that you must not declare `List x` if you only need `Collection x`
or even `Iterable x.` I can't agree more. Let's see the next one.

The [Dependency Inversion Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle)
means that instead of `ArrayList x,` you must
declare `List x` and let the provider of the object decide whether
it is
[`ArrayList`](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html) or
[`LinkedList.`](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/LinkedList.html)
This one also sounds reasonable to me.

However, how is all this different from the good old
"[loose coupling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_%28computer_programming%29)"
introduced together with cohesion by Constantine in 1974?
Do we really need to simplify and blur in order to learn better?
No, not to learn better, but to _sell_ better. Here goes my point.

## My point is...

The point being these principles are nothing but an explanation of
"cohesion and coupling" for dummies in a very primitive, ambiguous,
and marketable way. Dummies will buy books, seminars, and trainings,
but won't really be able to understand the logic behind them. Do they really
need to? They are just ~~monkeys~~
[coders]({% pst 2014/oct/2014-10-26-hacker-vs-programmer-mentality %}), right?

{% quote SOLID is a money-making instrument, not an instrument to make code better. %}

"But an object must be responsible for one thing!" is what I often hear at
conferences. People learn that mantra without even knowing
what cohesion is nor understanding what this "one thing" they are
praying for really is. There is no such thing as "one thing," guys! There are different
levels of cohesion.

Who is guilty? Uncle Bob &amp; Co.

They are no better than
[Ridley Scott]({% pst 2015/oct/2015-10-16-ridley-scott-and-joseph-goebbels %})
and other Hollywood money makers who
deliver primitive and easy-to-cry-at movies just to generate a profit. People
are getting dumber by watching---but this is not of their concern.
The same happens with magic OOP principles---programmers rely on
them, thinking the truth is right there while the real truth
is not understood even by the creators of this "magic."

SOLID is a money-making instrument, not an instrument to make
code better.
