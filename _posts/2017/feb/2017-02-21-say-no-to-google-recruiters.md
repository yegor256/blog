  Thanks to a recruiting process that left a bad taste
  in my mouth, I refuse to accept any further interviews
  from large tech companies unless they are on my terms.

This is a real story, and it's not only about Google. I'm getting emails from recruiters
at Amazon, Facebook, and smaller Silicon Valley startups. They
find me somehow, most likely through this blog, my
[books](/books.html), or my [GitHub account](https://github.com/yegor256).
They always start with "We're so impressed by your profile" and finish with
"Let's schedule an interview." I always reply with the same text, and they
always disappear, only to come back in a few months under a different name.
Let me explain my reasons; maybe you will do the same and we can change
this situation in the industry.

Disclaimer: I do realize that these are multi-billion-dollar companies, the best
in the industry, and I'm nothing compared to them.
I do realize that their recruiters don't care about my answers---they
simply click "delete" and move on. I also realize that they will never see
this post, and this article probably won't change anything. However,
I have to write it.

{% youtube ZhWOlaMqppM %}

This is what I'm sending back to them:

> Thanks for your email. I'm very interested indeed. I have nothing against
an interview. However, there is one condition: I have to be interviewed by the
person I will be working for. By my future direct manager.

The recruiter who gets this reply never gets back to me.

Why do I send this?

Well, because I learned my lesson two years ago,
when Amazon tried to recruit me. I got an email from the company
that said they were so impressed by my profile and couldn't wait
to start working with me. They needed me, nobody else. I was naive, and the
message did flatter me.

{% quote They paid for my ticket to fly there and a night in a 5-star hotel. I was impressed. %}

We scheduled an interview in the head office in Seattle. They paid for my ticket to fly
there (from San Francisco) and a night in a 5-star hotel. I was impressed. They definitely were
interested. So was I.

What happened at the interview was, most probably, very close to what
Max Howell [experienced](https://twitter.com/mxcl/status/608682016205344768)
[with Google](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9695102):
some programmers who didn't know a thing about my profile
asked me to invent some algorithms on a white board for almost
four hours. Did I manage? I don't think so. Did they make me an offer? No.

What did I learn?

That it was a waste of time. For both sides.

Their bureaucratic machine is designed to process hundreds of candidates
a month. In order to fish and attract them, there is an army of
~~monkeys~~
[recruiters]({% pst 2015/sep/2015-09-29-mayonnaise %})
sending warm emails to people like me.
They have to screen candidates somehow, and they are too lazy to make this
process effective and creative. They just send them through random
programmers who are supposed to ask as complex questions as possible.

I'm not saying that people who pass their tests are not good programmers.
I'm also not saying that I'm a good programmer---let's face it,
I didn't pass the test. I do believe this filtering system is rather good.
My point is that it contradicts the original email I got from the recruiter.

If she would have started her email with "We're looking for an algorithm
expert," we would never have gotten any further and would not have wasted our time.
Clearly, I'm not an expert in algorithms. There is no point in giving
me binary-tree-traversing questions; I don't know those answers
and will never be interested in learning them. I'm trying to be an expert
in something else, like [object-oriented design]({% pst 2016/nov/2016-11-29-eolang %}),
for example.

{% quote There is no point in giving me binary-tree-traversing questions; I don't know those answers and will never be interested in learning them. %}

There was a clear mismatch between my profile and the expectations of
the interviewers. I don't blame them, and I don't blame her. They
all were just ~~slaves~~
[employees]({% pst 2015/oct/2015-10-06-how-to-be-good-office-slave %}). I blame myself for not setting
this all straight at the very beginning.

I should have told her that I didn't want to be interviewed by _some_
programmers, because I would most certainly fail. There was no need to try. I wanted to be interviewed
by the person who really _needed_ me: my future boss. That person will
understand my profile and won't ask pointless questions about algorithms, simply because
he or she will know what my duties will be and what kind of problems
I will be capable of solving, if they hired me.

Unfortunately, as I keep observing from two years of bouncing
such emails back to recruiters, they can't change anything. They have
to provide formal and standard screening for everybody, beginning with
those same warm and flattering initial promises.

I'm sorry, recruiters, no more standard interviews for me.
