A few days ago, [DeepMind](https://deepmind.com) 
([acquired](https://techcrunch.com/2014/01/26/google-deepmind/) by Google in 2014) released
[AlphaCode](https://alphacode.deepmind.com) and self-published
a
[paper](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/AlphaCode/competition_level_code_generation_with_alphacode.pdf)
explaining how their artificial intelligence (AI) can "understand"
a programming contest task written in English and then write a Python, Java or C++ program, which
would work in about 30% of cases.
Earlier last year [OpenAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI) 
([$1B-funded](https://openai.com/blog/microsoft/) by Microsoft in 2019)
released [Codex](https://openai.com/blog/openai-codex/)
and published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03374), claiming
that their AI can also solve around 30% of the programming tasks it was
tested with.
[Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/ai-write-code-like-humans-bugs/),
the [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/65477c33-cb72-418d-b03d-b60cfc5a8b5d),
[The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/2/22914085/alphacode-ai-coding-program-automatic-deepmind-codeforce)
and many others have already announced the victory: 
AI [will replace programmers](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57914432) 
and we are all going to lose our jobs.

I would identify five beliefs about AI and its code-writing abilities,
which, in my opinion, are fundamental fallacies:

  * **AI writes code (NOT!)**<br/>
    It's not true.
    Neither AlphaCode nor Codex _write_ code. Instead, they _find_ it.
    According to the AlphaCode paper, "generating code that solves a specific task 
    requires _searching_ in a huge structured space of programs." 
    Even though Machine Learning (ML) makes searching
    faster, it doesn't make it writing. As far as I understand (the paper
    is pretty vague on the exact details of model training), they turn
    descriptions of programming tasks into sequences of numbers (tokenized characters!)
    and then label them with solutions found ... in GitHub or 
    [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com) open repositories.
    Then they ask the model to find the best solution for the vector of characters
    in question. Saying that they write code is similar to saying that
    Google draws pictures of cats when I search for a "black cat."

  * **AI understands requirements in a natural language (NOT!)**<br/>
    It doesn't really _understand_ anything.
    Neither AlphaCode nor Codex analyze the _semantics_ of the input. Whether it
    says "draw a green line" or "save a file," the AI sees just two sequences of characters:
    of length 17 and 11 respectively. It doesn't _know_ what "green" means nor how it's different
    from a "file." They tokenize text into vectors. If they used
    [CNL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_natural_language) it would
    be understanding, but they don't.

  * **AI pair-programs with a human (NOT!)**<br/>
    We may expect AI not to entirely replace us programmers, but instead help us
    write certain blocks of code: [Copilot](https://copilot.github.com) 
    ([released](https://github.blog/2021-06-29-introducing-github-copilot-ai-pair-programmer/) 
    by [GitHub](https://github.com) in 2021) 
    is a notable example, [powered](https://hackernoon.com/openais-new-code-generator-github-copilot-and-codex-bb143773)
    by the same Codex. A few months ago I got an early access to Codex and played a bit with
    its features. My impression, as a programmer, was that it was neither able to
    write an entire program nor did the blocks of
    code it produced in response to my requests fit together. They were syntactically
    valid and implemented the functionality requested, but the AI was falling short in combining
    them the way I, a human, might agree to maintain them later.

  * **AI autocompletes, that's why they can write (NOT!)**<br/>
    Indeed, there are a few products which do code autocompletion
    with the use of ML, for example [Codota](https://www.codota.com),
    [Tabnine](https://www.tabnine.com),
    and
    [Kite](https://www.kite.com).
    However, they don't work with natural languages.
    These are two different research problems:
    1) how to [autocomplete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocomplete) 
    an existing program with known
    functionality and an already existing [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree), 
    and 
    2) how to turn natural language text into an AST.
    As far as I understand, they don't and never will overlap.

  * **AI just needs time to mature (NOT!)**<br/>
    [Some](https://spectrum.ieee.org/openai-wont-replace-coders) believe
    that AI will replace programmers, but "that day won't arrive any time soon."
    However, it seems to me that it's not a matter of maturity. The very 
    direction researchers of OpenAI and DeepMind are trying to pursue is a dead end.
    ML is just not the right tool to turn unstructured English text into a well-structured 
    AST which is parseable by C++ compiler. To do this we need the AI to 
    learn the semantics of the natural language and then, using 
    _creativity_ and _imagination_,
    create all necessary AST elements in the right order. 
    I simply don't believe that ML is the right technology for this.

To conclude, ML will never write our code, because ... it's just not
the right tool for the job.
However, it may be suitable for other things, like autocompletion, 
refactoring, bug fixing, optimization, and so on. I'm particularly interested
in automated refactoring: imagine a large legacy code base given to AI,
which improves certain parts of it, making the code faster,
safer, more readable, or shorter. Maybe it will even upgrade the code to newer frameworks, SDKs,
and dependencies. This is where ML already helps and will help more,
improving _existing_ ASTs.

Trying to apply ML to code generating is a road to nowhere, which
only wastes resources and ... boosts stocks of Google and Microsoft.

Besides, how much good will it do to the industry if programmers write
code mostly by finding samples on the Internet, copying, and sticking them together?
Many of them already do that even without AI.
The [analysis](https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/12/30/how-often-do-people-actually-copy-and-paste-from-stack-overflow-now-we-know/) 
recently done by Stack Overflow demonstrates that "the higher a user's reputation, 
the less often they are copying." Less skillful programmers tend to copy.
Is this a good tendency? Do we want AI to push it further?

Will AI ever be able to write code by reading natural language requirements?
Yes, it will. When we invent artificial creativity.
