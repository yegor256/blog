      <h1>Zerocracy: Survival Guide</h1>
      

<p><a href="https://www.zerocracy.com">Zerocracy</a> is a great platform to manage
a software development project … if you understand how the
world of wild animals, also known as pay-by-result freelancing
microtaskers, works. If you treat them as you used to
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OFgf8XYI2A">treat</a> traditional
full-time programmers, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdrtZIW5JtY">you will lose</a>.
You will lose your money, your time
and will blame Zerocracy. I don’t want this to happen, that’s why
this blog post with a short list of important principles/hints.</p>



<p><strong>Proof-of-Concept First</strong>.
Don’t let the architect invite programmers to the project, until the
prototype is ready, build pipeline is configured,
and the product is deployed to production, as our
<a href="https://www.yegor256.com/2014/10/06/software-project-lifecycle.html">Lifecycle</a> suggests.
You have to confirm
visually that the prototype proves that the key technical objective
of the project is achievable. Only then you start adding programmers to the team.</p>

<p><strong>Strict Pipeline</strong>.
Don’t approve the prototype unless its build pipeline includes
1) unit testing, 2) static analysis, and 3) test coverage control,
as this <a href="https://www.yegor256.com/2015/06/08/deadly-sins-software-project.html">blog post</a> suggests.
There could be more elements there, but these three are absolutely mandatory.</p>

<p><strong>Read-Only Master</strong>.
Never let anybody, including yourself, any third-party experts, your full-timers,
or auditors to have write access to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code> branch, as
this <a href="https://www.yegor256.com/2014/07/21/read-only-master-branch.html">blog post</a>
explains. If the architect
insists on having it, report this behavior to us, we will crucify him/her.</p>

<p><strong>Don’t Negotiate Rates</strong>.
Don’t pay less than freelancers are asking. Well, sometimes you can do that,
but as a rule I would suggest to agree to what they are asking. Our management
system is very strict, demanding, and stressful. You may lose good people
if they will be financially unsatisfied. So, don’t be cheap, you will only lose
and remain with weak programmers.</p>

<p><strong>Don’t Chat</strong>.
Most likely you used to communicate with programmers in chats like Slack
or Telegram. You will do yourself a bad favor if you continue doing it
with Zerocracy architect or, God forbids, programmers. GitHub must be your
only communication instrument, as
this <a href="https://www.yegor256.com/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html">blog post</a> suggests.
You still find phone calls more convenient?
Blame yourself when the project falls apart.</p>

<p><strong>Don’t Trust Them</strong>.
Every week you absolutely must invite an external auditor to your repository
and ask them to check what is wrong and what can be done better, as
suggested <a href="https://www.yegor256.com/2014/12/18/independent-technical-reviews.html">here</a>
and <a href="https://www.yegor256.com/2017/11/21/trust-pay-lose.html">here</a>.
Demand them to answer at least <a href="https://www.yegor256.com/2019/04/02/software-project-review-checklist.html">these questions</a> and
provide their feedback in form of GitHub tickets.</p>

<p><strong>Talk to the Community</strong>.
When you are ready to start a project, submit the <a href="https://www.zerocracy.com/rfp">RfP</a>.
Right after that, join our <a href="https://t.me/zerocracy">Telegram chat</a>. Stay there
and ask all questions you have about your project, the progress you have,
the mistakes you think your architect or your team is making. Don’t be quiet,
share your concerns! We will help. If you try to resolve them yourself,
blame yourself when the project fails.</p>

</ul>

<p><strong>Focus Them</strong>.
Don’t let them work without focus control. Make sure your architect
knows which parts of the scope are the most important and focus the
team to work with them first. This
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3HwEtFU2wo">video</a> explains how
<a href="http://www.zerocracy.com/policy.html#5">boost factor</a>,
milestones, and
<a href="http://www.zerocracy.com/policy.html#19">manual assignments</a>
can be used for that.</p>

<p><strong>Hire QA</strong>.
We have a special <a href="https://www.yegor256.com/2016/07/10/software-project-roles.html">role</a>
in Zerocracy, known as Quality Assurance (QA).
It was invented in order to prevent abuse of our rules of work.
It is strongly recommended to hire a QA when you start a project. You may
not see why it’s important, but trust us, without QA your project
is at a huge risk of losing discipline <em>and</em> money.</p>

<p><strong>Keep Recruiting</strong>.
Even when you think your team is full and you have enough programmers,
don’t rest assured. Hire new people constantly. Publish your project
on our <a href="https://www.0crat.com/board">board</a> and announce it in our
<a href="https://t.me/zerocracy">Telegram chat</a>. The larger the team, the
more chances for success your project has.</p>

<p><strong>Release Daily</strong>.
Right after the prototype is ready, make sure your product is being released
at least every day. Make sure you can release it yourself, without any
assistance of the architect. Insist that the architect configures the
delivery pipeline and give it to your control.</p>
