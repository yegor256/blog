I even <a href="/2017/11/21/trust-pay-lose.html">said recently</a> that there is no excuse for not doing them. Moreover, the more we trust programmers, the higher the necessity to review their projects regularly. Here is a short summary of what a report from a reviewer must include.</p><amp-img src="/images/2019/04/the-people-vs-larry-flynt.jpg"alt="The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996) by Milos Forman"height="773"width="1856"layout="responsive"></amp-img><p>I tried to touch on this subject in a few recent talks: <a href="https://youtu.be/oiNI2jF46h0">Make Customers Trust You</a> at BDMSummit 2017, <a href="https://youtu.be/Rip_04Bv3Jk">How to Be Honest and Keep a Client</a> at PMCon Kharkiv 2017, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLk_5BmgTVk">How to Avoid Outsourcing Disaster</a> at <a href="http://outsourceforum.org/">Kyiv Outsourcing Forum 2017</a>. Also, there are a number of blog posts along the same lines, including <a href="/2015/06/08/deadly-sins-software-project.html">Seven Deadly Sins of a Software Project</a>, <a href="/2015/05/21/avoid-software-outsourcing-disaster.html">How to Avoid a Software Outsourcing Disaster</a>, and <a href="/2015/06/15/software-outsourcing-survival-guide.html">Software Outsourcing Survival Guide</a>. Here, finally, is a more or less complete list of things a good report must include.<p>Basically it’s a list of questions a reviewer must answer. When all the answers are collected, the report is ready. The most important questions are at the top.<ul><li>Is the release procedure documented, automated, and does it work?<li>Do releases happen frequently, at least once a week?<li>How big is the technical debt (the things that “eventually” should be fixed)?<li>Is the delivery pipeline strong enough to reject mistakes?<li>How clean is the code? How many <a href="/2016/02/03/design-patterns-and-anti-patterns.html">anti-patterns</a> appear?<li>Are all bugs and features registered as <a href="/2014/11/24/principles-of-bug-tracking.html">tickets</a>?<li>Is the code base covered by unit tests, and is coverage visible?<li>Are “Work for Hire” agreements signed with all developers?<li>Are key architectural technical decisions documented?<li>Is static analysis in place and <a href="/2018/01/16/educational-aspect-of-static-analysis.html">mandatory</a> for new changes?<li>Is <a href="/2014/10/08/continuous-integration-is-dead.html">CI</a> in place, and are its reports taken into account?<li>Is master branch <a href="/2014/07/21/read-only-master-branch.html">read-only</a>?<li>Are programming metrics collected and regularly reviewed?<li>Is the source code repository under the customer’s ownership?<li>Is the requirements documentation <a href="/2015/11/10/ten-mistakes-in-specs.html">short and up to date</a>?<li>Do key classes, methods and functions have in-code documentation?<li>Is the source code repository garbage free?<li>Are UI/UX interfaces documented?<li>Are the production logs visible and regularly reviewed?<li>How responsive is the team to the tickets?<li>Does Git have a clear history of documented changes?</ul><p>Essentially, this is a very short compilation of the most important things that you can find in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability_Maturity_Model_Integration">CMMI</a>. They require all this, and a large list of other things on top. But a small project doesn’t need everything that they ask you to have. My list is shorter and, I’m sure, will be just enough for most of you.<p>By the way, you can see the reports volunteers create for the participants of my <a href="/award.html">Software Quality Award</a>. They analyze open source projects and briefly report the problems they find. I believe that they are trying to answer exactly the same set of questions.</article>
