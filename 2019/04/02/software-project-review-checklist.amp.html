      <h1>Software Project Review Checklist</h1>
      <p>A few years ago I wrote about the
<a href="/2014/12/18/independent-technical-reviews.html">independent technical reviews</a>
any software project must regularly go through in order
to make sure everything is under control. I even
<a href="/2017/11/21/trust-pay-lose.html">said recently</a>
that there is no excuse for not doing them. Moreover, the more
we trust programmers, the higher the necessity to review their projects regularly.
Here is a short summary of what a report from a reviewer must include.</p>



<amp-img src="/images/2019/04/the-people-vs-larry-flynt.jpg" alt="The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996) by Milos Forman" height="773" width="1856" layout="responsive"></amp-img>

<p>I tried to touch on this subject in a few recent talks:
<a href="https://youtu.be/oiNI2jF46h0">Make Customers Trust You</a> at BDMSummit 2017,
<a href="https://youtu.be/Rip_04Bv3Jk">How to Be Honest and Keep a Client</a> at PMCon Kharkiv 2017,
and
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLk_5BmgTVk">How to Avoid Outsourcing Disaster</a> at <a href="http://outsourceforum.org/">Kyiv Outsourcing Forum 2017</a>.
Also, there are a number of blog posts along the same lines, including
<a href="/2015/06/08/deadly-sins-software-project.html">Seven Deadly Sins of a Software Project</a>,
<a href="/2015/05/21/avoid-software-outsourcing-disaster.html">How to Avoid a Software Outsourcing Disaster</a>,
and
<a href="/2015/06/15/software-outsourcing-survival-guide.html">Software Outsourcing Survival Guide</a>.
Here, finally, is a more or less complete list of things a good report must include.</p>

<p>Basically it’s a list of questions a reviewer must answer.
When all the answers are collected, the report is ready.
The most important questions are at the top.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is the release procedure documented, automated, and does it work?</li>
  <li>Do releases happen frequently, at least once a week?</li>
  <li>How big is the technical debt (the things that “eventually” should be fixed)?</li>
  <li>Is the delivery pipeline strong enough to reject mistakes?</li>
  <li>How clean is the code? How many <a href="/2016/02/03/design-patterns-and-anti-patterns.html">anti-patterns</a> appear?</li>
  <li>Are all bugs and features registered as <a href="/2014/11/24/principles-of-bug-tracking.html">tickets</a>?</li>
  <li>Is the code base covered by unit tests, and is coverage visible?</li>
  <li>Are “Work for Hire” agreements signed with all developers?</li>
  <li>Are key architectural technical decisions documented?</li>
  <li>Is static analysis in place and <a href="/2018/01/16/educational-aspect-of-static-analysis.html">mandatory</a> for new changes?</li>
  <li>Is <a href="/2014/10/08/continuous-integration-is-dead.html">CI</a> in place, and are its reports taken into account?</li>
  <li>Is master branch <a href="/2014/07/21/read-only-master-branch.html">read-only</a>?</li>
  <li>Are programming metrics collected and regularly reviewed?</li>
  <li>Is the source code repository under the customer’s ownership?</li>
  <li>Is the requirements documentation <a href="/2015/11/10/ten-mistakes-in-specs.html">short and up to date</a>?</li>
  <li>Do key classes, methods and functions have in-code documentation?</li>
  <li>Is the source code repository garbage free?</li>
  <li>Are UI/UX interfaces documented?</li>
  <li>Are the production logs visible and regularly reviewed?</li>
  <li>How responsive is the team to the tickets?</li>
  <li>Does Git have a clear history of documented changes?</li>
</ul>

<p>Essentially, this is a very short compilation of the most important things that
you can find in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability_Maturity_Model_Integration">CMMI</a>.
They require all this, and a large list of other things on top. But a small
project doesn’t need everything that they ask you to have. My list is shorter
and, I’m sure, will be just enough for most of you.</p>

<p>By the way, you can see the reports volunteers create for the participants
of my <a href="/award.html">Software Quality Award</a>. They analyze open source projects
and briefly report the problems they find. I believe that they are trying to answer
exactly the same set of questions.</p>
