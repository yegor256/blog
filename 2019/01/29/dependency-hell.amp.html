      <h1>My Recipe Against Dependency Hell</h1>
      <p>Do you specify exact versions of your dependencies? I mean, when your
software package depends on another one, do you write down, in your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pom.xml</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gruntfile</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gemfile</code>, or what have you, its version as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1.13.5</code> or just
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1.+</code>? I always <a href="https://twitter.com/yegor256/status/1059856548112068608">thought</a>
that it was better to use exact version numbers,
to avoid the so called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell">dependency hell</a>,
and <a href="https://blog.danlew.net/2015/09/09/dont-use-dynamic-versions-for-your-dependencies/">I was not alone</a>.
However, very soon I <a href="https://twitter.com/yegor256/status/1060538705260265474">realized</a>
that dynamic versions, like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1.+</code>, give more flexibility.
Just a few weeks ago I realized that neither approach
is right and found myself a hybrid formula. No surprise, I again saw that
<a href="https://brock.io/post/repeatable_android_builds/">I wasn’t alone</a>.</p>



<amp-img src="/images/2019/01/sin-noticias-de-dios.jpg" alt="Sin noticias de Dios (2001) by Agustín Díaz Yanes" height="848" width="2006" layout="responsive"></amp-img>

<p>First, let me explain what’s wrong with fixed dependencies.</p>

<p>Say I create a library X, which depends on, for example, a logging
facility, which is a third-party library, not mine. Thus my library X has
a <em>dependency</em>. The logging library has a version number, such as
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1.13.5</code>. I put this text into the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pom.xml</code> file of X:</p>

<div class="language-xml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;dependency&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;groupId&gt;</span>com.example<span class="nt">&lt;/groupId&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;artifactId&gt;</span>log-me<span class="nt">&lt;/artifactId&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;version&gt;</span>1.13.5<span class="nt">&lt;/version&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/dependency&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Many advocates of fixed dependencies argue that it’s very important
to stick to the version <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1.13.5</code>, instead of using a more flexible dynamic
one: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1.13)</code> (i.e. any version, provided it is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1.13</code> or newer).
Why? Because future versions may introduce something that
will break the build of X. They may change interfaces, rename classes or methods,
or delete something that I’m using. You never know what the authors of this
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">log-me</code> library might do. That’s why it’s better to hard-wire ourselves to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1.13.5</code> and
call it a day.</p>

<p>This is true.</p>

<p>But.</p>

<p>What if the library X is used by another library Y, which also depends on
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">log-me</code> but needs version <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1.14.1</code>. Boom! There will be a conflict
in library Y: Maven, the package manager, won’t be able to decide
which version to use. It will be necessary to resolve the conflict somehow.
In the case of Maven it’s resolvable, in the case of, for example,
<a href="https://github.com/ruby/rake">Rake</a>, it’s not (to my knowledge).</p>



<p>To resolve this problem, library Y will have to explicitly say which version
has to be used. But it can’t be sure that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1.14.1</code> will work correctly with
library X. To confirm that it does, it would have to be tested by the authors of library
X. So the best the creators of library Y can do is to try it and hope
for the best. With other build tools, like Rake, the authors will have no choice,
but to ask the authors of library X to upgrade to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1.14.1</code> and release
a new version. Then, library Y will be able to use library X.</p>

<p>This problem would not exist if library X depended on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1.13</code> instead.
But, as I mentioned above, in that case its authors would be planting a time bomb—eventually
one of the future versions will definitely break the build.</p>

<p>So what is the solution?</p>

<p>Here is my formula: If you trust the authors of the library, use dynamic versioning;
if you don’t, use a fixed version.</p>

<p>What I mean is, do you trust that they are professional enough to think about
backward compatibility and to follow the principles of <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a>?
If they are careful enough to not delete or modify something
that may affect future versions without also changing the major number of the version,
then you can trust them. How do you know who to trust? I don’t trust anyone, except
my own libraries and a very small number of other libraries which I have reviewed in GitHub and checked
the quality of their repositories.</p>

<p>Of course, you can’t fully trust anyone, but this is the formula I
have for myself now. You can see how it works in this
<a href="https://github.com/zold-io/zold/blob/master/zold.gemspec">Gemfile</a>, for example.
Pay attention to the version numbers. Those that start with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~&gt;</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&gt;=</code> are dynamic,
while others are fixed. It’s a hybrid approach, but it works for me.</p>

<p>Maybe it will help you too.</p>
