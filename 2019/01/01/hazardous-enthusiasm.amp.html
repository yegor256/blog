Over the years I have realized that there is a pattern in their behavior, which I need to be <del>scared</del> aware of. I call it “hazardous enthusiasm.” Here are the symptoms.</p><amp-img src="/images/2019/01/the-thin-red-line.jpg"alt="The Thin Red Line (1998) by Terrence Malick"height="544"width="1280"layout="responsive"></amp-img><p>A new developer joins the project. He is full of energy, talks a lot, spends a lot of time on the project, submits new tickets, and suggests improvements. He looks like a great candidate and we all are happy to see him on board. He is a godsend!<p>Then, when things become clearer for him, he starts criticizing the architecture. He <a href="/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html">approaches</a> me in Telegram and asks me whether I realize that the architecture is a total mess and that if we don’t change it immediately the project will be dead in a few <del>days</del> weeks. I attempt to assure him that I understand, but… He immediately suggests an improvement: We have to re-do it all from scratch or at least get rid of that collection of objects and replace it with a singleton and a very nice <a href="/2014/12/01/orm-offensive-anti-pattern.html">ORM</a> library he’s been using for a year, and it’s just great, blah blah blah… OK? Let’s do it? Why not?<p>I have very little to say and instead ask him to submit a ticket. I try to assure him that I will investigate the possibilities as soon as I can. I also try to remind him, in a very polite way, that I’m an <a href="/2014/10/12/who-is-software-architect.html">architect</a> here and, even though his ideas sound great, I can’t accept them all at once. Then he goes: “Let me show you!”<p>In a few days I get a giant pull request with a lot of changes that look interesting but that go completely against almost every principle I’ve managed to embed into the existing architecture. What do I do? I feel sorry for him. I have to reject the pull request and I try to explain why. But there is no reasonable explanation. I’m just a bad guy who doesn’t like innovative ideas.<p>What happens next? Well, he disappears.<p>I’ve seen this happen many times, with various people. Were they all incompetent programmers? I don’t think so. They were great, from a technical point of view. But they all lacked the very important skill which, I believe, distinguishes a professional software engineer from a guy who merely learned how to write Java code: <a href="/2017/11/28/microtasking.html">microtasking</a>.<p>They simply don’t know how to break their changes, which in most cases are by no means useless, into smaller pieces and deliver them incrementally. They want to push everything they have in mind in one large chunk. Of course, they fail. Because there is a bad guy in front of them: me, the architect.<p>What makes their cases fatal is the enthusiasm. If they were less aggressive and eager to do the right thing, they would survive. But they can’t wait and they don’t want to apply half-measures. They want to fix the world in one huge pull request.<p>Why can’t I just accept their changes and let them fix the code the way they want, you may ask? Because I know that even though they may look like good programmers, they would be lousy architects, exactly because they lack the skill of <a href="/2017/11/28/microtasking.html">microtasking</a>. If I accept what they suggest, I will simply transfer my architect’s <a href="/2015/05/11/software-architect-responsibilities.html">responsibilities</a> to them. It will be their architecture from now on. And what’s wrong with that? Well, their lack of that skill. They won’t be able to be architects, because they can’t manage changes, can’t deliver them incrementally, and can’t understand the dynamics of collaborative work with the source code.<p>They are <a href="/2014/10/26/hacker-vs-programmer-mentality.html">hackers</a>, not designers or <a href="/2018/06/26/are-you-an-architect.html">architects</a>.<p>Honestly, I feel sorry when I lose them.</article>
