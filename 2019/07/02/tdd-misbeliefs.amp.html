      <h1>TDD Misbeliefs</h1>
      <p>While I was working with a
<a href="/2017/03/24/tdd-that-works.html">previous article</a> about
Test-Driven Development (TDD)
I read many blog posts and a few books on the subject and found
out that I disagree with a few of them; even some that are pretty important.
It seems that most software experts simply misunderstand how software
development works. Maybe because they are not really programmers, but
are instead book authors and conference speakers.</p>

  <p>If the changes you make to the production code, pursuant to a test,
  make that test pass, but would not make other unwritten tests pass,
  then you are likely making the production code too specific.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="red">I disagree</span>.
This statement goes against the very philosophy of testing: “a passing test
is a <em>weak</em> test.” Unfortunately, a traditional understanding of testing
is quite the opposite: tests <em>must pass</em> to make us happy. Thus, if we
keep thinking about how to make our future tests pass we will shoot
ourselves in the foot: tests will pass and the code quality will go down.
Instead, we must design our code in a way that makes it easy to break with
the future tests. The code must help its tests to break it! Because
a test that is easy to make “red” is a good test. A test that is always
“green” is a useless test. Uncle Bob, I’m sure, is aware of that.</p>

  <p>You’ll run through several cycles very quickly, then find yourself
  slowing down and spending more time on refactoring.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="red">I disagree</span>.
I have nothing against the first two steps: 1) the test is “red” because
it doesn’t pass, and 2) the test is “green” when the code is fixed and
passes. I disagree that refactoring is a responsibility of the person
who fixes the test. If the code needs refactoring, it’s a <em>bug</em>, just
like any other bug, either functional or design. It has to be reported,
assigned and paid for. We must not do any code modifications, no matter
how good our intentions are, if they are not required <em>and paid for</em>. Refactoring
after fixing the test is a frivolous violation of management and coordination
structure in a project.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You don’t have to write tests for Test Doubles because
  the actual unit tests and the production code are
  the tests for those pieces of code.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="red">I disagree</span>.
Test Doubles (also known as
<a href="/2014/09/23/built-in-fake-objects.html">fake objects</a>)
are the tools that help us find our where the code is broken. If the tool
is unreliable, how can we test our code against it? This reminds me of an old
joke where a patient comes to the doctor and says “Help me doc, my body hurts anywhere
I touch it with my finger!” The doctor answers
“It’s just your finger—it’s broken!” A very similar situation occurs here:
If we test our production objects with broken Test Doubles, they will all look
broken.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Code-to-test ratios above 1:2 is a smell, above 1:3 is a stink.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="red">I disagree</span>.
I don’t know exactly what units of measurement were used to compare the
“code” and the “test,” but I can only assume Lines-of-Code. I was curious and
decided to calculate this ratio in a few projects of mine. First, I tried
<a href="https://github.com/jcabi/jcabi-github">jcabi-github</a>,
an immutable GitHub Java API client. The numbers were:
9.8K LoC in production classes,
6.2K in built-in fake classes, and
16.2K in test classes.
Thus, the ratio was 9.8 to 22.4, which meant 1:2.3. Somewhere between
a “smell” and a “stink,” according to David. Then I calculated the ratio
for a few other projects of mine:
<a href="https://github.com/jcabi/jcabi-http">jcabi-http</a> (1:1),
<a href="https://github.com/yegor256/xembly">xembly</a> (1:0.92),
<a href="https://github.com/yegor256/takes">takes</a> (1:0.91), and
<a href="https://github.com/yegor256/rultor">rultor</a> (1:0.6). It seems that the higher
the ratio the higher my <em>confidence</em> in the product’s quality. Thus, I don’t think that
it’s a smell or a stink. Instead, in a yummy-scented product the amount
of test code is a few times larger than its production counterpart.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I get paid for code that works, not for tests.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="red">I disagree</span>.
Tests are not a separate product which either we are paid for or not.
Tests are part of the code. An instrument of its development, maintenance
and validation. Tests are similar to, say, file names. We don’t write
our code naming all the files <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1.java</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2.java</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">234.java</code>, and then
say: “Now you pay me so that I can rename them properly.” That would be weird,
right? That’s how the statement “I’m not paid for writing tests” sounds
to me: weird. Do we really have to be paid to name files correctly? We just
do it, because it’s convenient for us. Because proper self-descriptive
file names make our code more readable and maintainable. It’s impossible to
imagine a modern maintainable code base without tests. I would actually
suggest changing that phrase to: “I get paid for code that is tested, not
just for code.”</p>

<p>I will keep updating this post. If you know a “good” article about TDD,
please send it <a href="mailto:tdd@yegor256.com">my way</a>; maybe I’ll find
something interesting to quote from it.</p>
