This is obvious. The question though is how exactly you make it happen. How do you make them do what <em>you</em> want, according to <em>your</em> plans, achieving <em>your</em> objectives, to <em>your</em> quality standards, and within the borders of <em>your</em> requirements and expectations? Some of you may say that these are <em>our</em> objectives, <em>our</em> mutual plans, <em>our</em> quality standards, and <em>our</em> requirements. This may be true, but initially they are still only yours. How do you make them theirs? There are two ways: a traditional one and an <em>inversive</em> one.</p><amp-img src="/images/2019/07/the-gambler.jpg"alt="The Gambler (2014) by Rupert Wyatt"height="884"width="2138"layout="responsive"></amp-img><p>Here is how it works, over and over again. First you hire them, and all of them are experts. Well, most of them. At least this is what their resumes say. Then you sit together and define a plan. It looks doable and you <a href="/2019/05/28/trust-or-not.html">trust</a> them. They start working and soon enough you realize that some of them are lagging behind the promises made in the plan. You start <del>begging</del> asking them to correct, to improve, to be more effective, to be more responsive, to commit, and to stay focused. You may even hire an Agile coach to train them. They improve, but not for long.<p>You have “to stay on top of things” and never miss anything, if you want the project to succeed. You have to <em>care</em>. You have to be in the office all the time. You know, from your experience, that without your permanent attention people don’t do what they are supposed to do. Eventually you start believing, together with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Drucker">Peter Drucker</a>, that “management is art” since you never know exactly how you have to <a href="/2016/01/05/how-to-punish-employees.html">support</a> each of them, because every person is a Universe and must be taken care of, individually.<p>This is traditional management and it’s all about <em>you</em>. You have to <em>care</em>, you have to <em>worry</em>, you have to <em>be there</em> to make things happen, and you have to <em>chase</em> them. You <em>need</em> their results and they may provide them… if they feel like it. If you don’t <em>collect</em> the results, you most probably won’t get anything, or very little.<p>There is, however, a better alternative, which looks like <em>inversive management</em> to me. Here is a practical example. I hired a researcher a few days ago. She was supposed to find and build me a list of the most influential Twitter accounts of tech journalists. Here is how she suggested I structure our contract: “You pay me $5 per hour.” This would be traditional management. She works and I chase her, asking how is it going, is it a good quality list, is it big enough, are there any problems with finding the right people, and so on. I would have to worry about this small project.<p>Here is what I suggested instead: “I pay you $40 when the list is complete.” Now she has to chase me, to deliver the list to me and to collect the payment. She has to convince me that the list is good, long enough, and of good quality. She has to worry about the deadline, about the requirements, and about all the other problems related to the work. They’re all her troubles.<p>I made her chase me.<p>This, I believe, is the cure for all management problems: <strong>make them chase you</strong>.<p>How do you do that? Just like I did—you turn yourself into a <em>buyer</em> making them be <em>sellers</em> of their results. You’ve got the resources (money), which you are ready to release if your people provide you what you need. Obviously, you don’t need them <a href="/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html"><em>to work</em></a>, you need their <em>results</em>, such as a list of emails, a new feature, a bug fix, a new document, or maybe a new UI mock-up.<p>You, as a pragmatic and smart project manager, define what the project needs from its participants, you put a <em>price tag</em> on each need, and let programmers worry about how they deliver, how they solve their own problems, and how to convince you that their results are good enough to be paid for.<p>Of course, it’s easy to put a price tag on a simple gig, like building a list of Twitter accounts. It’s much more difficult to do the same for a complex task, like writing source code or administering a database. However, if you don’t do it, you will be <a href="/2017/08/01/how-to-manage-a-manager.html">managed</a> by your programmers, not the other way around. You will have to constantly chase them and literally beg for results. They will be relaxed, you will be worried. They will get paid, you will be <a href="/2019/06/19/how-much-they-suffer.html">punished</a> for their mistakes.<p>I suggest you <em>invert</em> the situation and let <em>them</em> worry.</article>
