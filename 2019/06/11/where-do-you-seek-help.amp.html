I said “Why not?” and asked them what was going on. They told me that their PostgreSQL server was running slow because it was doing this and that, and when they restarted it it was repeating this and that… Long story short, I had no idea what they were talking about, even though I was a user of PostgreSQL for many years. My first reaction was: “Have you posted a question on Stack Overflow yet?” They answered: “We still <em>hope</em> that that won’t be necessary.” I replied, surprised: “Huh?”</p><amp-img src="/images/2019/06/the-tribe.jpg"alt="The Tribe (2014) by Myroslav Slaboshpytskyi"height="604"width="1400"layout="responsive"></amp-img><p>Why was <a href="https://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a> their last resort? They didn’t explain, but I believe I know the answer: they would feel ashamed. For them Stack Overflow is a place for losers who can’t solve problems by themselves. It is a place for those who are not worth the money their <del>owners</del> bosses pay them. It is a place where lazy programmers ask questions and expect answers instead of working hard in their offices and resolving everything on their own.<p>This is the mentality of a <a href="/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html">slave</a>.<p>This is the mentality of someone who is paid <a href="/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html">for the time</a> they spend in the office or in front of the computer, not for the results they deliver. It is only logical that if they are paid for <em>being programmers</em>, seeking help at Stack Overflow is a declaration of incompetence. You do it once, you will be excused, you do it twice, your boss will <a href="/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html">start wondering</a> whether you are the right resource to be spending money on. But if you do it regularly—you will <a href="/2016/01/05/how-to-punish-employees.html">definitely</a> be <a href="/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html">fired</a>. Thus, a good slave doesn’t do that. A good slave does everything possible to <a href="/2017/08/01/how-to-manage-a-manager.html"><em>look</em></a> busy and competent.<p>Are you a slave?<p>Now, to the contrary, someone who is paid <a href="https://www.zerocracy.com">for the results delivered</a> has a completely <a href="/2018/04/17/how-to-be-lazy.html">different</a> mindset. Why would Stack Overflow be a <em>last resort</em> for a freelancer, who is paid for the problems they manage to solve, no matter how much time they spend on them nor where they seek help? Moreover, the <a href="/2015/01/15/how-to-cut-corners.html">faster</a> such a freelancer can <a href="/2018/01/23/sociotech-skills.html">find help</a>, the better an engineer he or she is.<p>In the story above, my friend had the right mindset. The moment he found out that his team couldn’t solve the problem, he came to me, and a few other people. He was not a software developer, that’s why he didn’t know about Stack Overflow. But he was seeking help everywhere <em>around</em> his team, while his <del>slaves</del> programmers were trying to find a solution by themselves.<p>Maybe that’s why he is a co-founder and they are his employees?<p>Now, here is my short list of places <em>you</em> should seek help when you don’t know what to do with your PostgreSQL and you have no time. The list is ordered. The places where you <em>start</em> are at the top, the last resort is at the bottom:<ul><li><p>Search in Google<li><p>Post to Stack Overflow<li><p>Read books<li><p>Ask friends<li><p>Keep trying</ul><p>Let me emphasize again: it depends on who you are. If you are a slave on a payroll and feel happy about that, you should not listen to the advice in this blog post. It will only ruin your <a href="/2017/01/24/career-advice.html">career</a>. However, if you are a freelancer, stop being embarrassed for not knowing something!<p>Your job is <a href="/2015/02/16/it-is-not-a-school.html">not</a> <em>to know</em> or <em>to be smart</em>. Your job is to find solutions and fix problems. How you do that is your <em>own business</em>. It’s not the business of your boss, your <a href="/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html">project manager</a>, or your product owner.<p>Each <a href="/2017/11/28/microtasking.html">(micro-)task</a> you resolve has a <a href="/2018/01/09/micro-budgeting.html">budget</a> and you are <a href="/2014/04/15/definition-of-done.html">fully responsible</a> for it while it is assigned to you. You solve it the way <em>you</em> want it to be solved.<p>Don’t be ashamed of asking for help, just like my friend was not ashamed of telling me that his team couldn’t fix the PostgreSQL issue. He was thinking about his business results, not about what I would think about him and his team. He didn’t care about that. He needed the bloody PostgreSQL to work!<p>Do the same. Be a business man, not a slave.</article>
