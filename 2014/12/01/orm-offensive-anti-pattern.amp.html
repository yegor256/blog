    <p>TL;DR ORM is a terrible <a href="/2016/02/03/design-patterns-and-anti-patterns.html">anti-pattern</a>
that violates all principles of
object-oriented programming, tearing objects apart and turning them into dumb and passive
data bags. There is no excuse for ORM existence in any application, be it
a small web app or an enterprise-size system with thousands of tables and CRUD
manipulations on them. What is the alternative? <strong>SQL-speaking objects</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="how-orm-works">How ORM Works</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping">Object-relational mapping</a>
(ORM) is a technique (a.k.a. design pattern) of
accessing a relational database from an object-oriented language
(Java, for example). There are multiple implementations of ORM
in almost every language; for example:
<a href="http://hibernate.org/orm/">Hibernate</a> for Java,
<a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html">ActiveRecord</a> for Ruby on Rails,
<a href="http://www.doctrine-project.org/">Doctrine</a> for PHP, and
<a href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a> for Python.
In Java, the ORM design is even standardized as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Persistence_API">JPA</a>.</p>

<p>First, let&#39;s see how ORM works, by example. Let&#39;s use Java, PostgreSQL, and Hibernate.
Let&#39;s say we have a single table in the database, called <code>post</code>:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">+-----+------------+--------------------------+
| id  | date       | title                    |
+-----+------------+--------------------------+
|   9 | 10/24/2014 | How to cook a sandwich   |
|  13 | 11/03/2014 | My favorite movies       |
|  27 | 11/17/2014 | How much I love my job   |
+-----+------------+--------------------------+</code></pre></figure>

<p>Now we want to CRUD-manipulate this table from our Java app (CRUD
stands for create, read, update, and delete). First, we should create
a <code>Post</code> class (I&#39;m sorry it&#39;s so long, but that&#39;s the best I can do):</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="nd">@Entity</span>
<span class="nd">@Table</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;post&quot;</span><span class="o">)</span>
<span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">Post</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="kd">private</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">id</span><span class="o">;</span>
  <span class="kd">private</span> <span class="n">Date</span> <span class="n">date</span><span class="o">;</span>
  <span class="kd">private</span> <span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">title</span><span class="o">;</span>
  <span class="nd">@Id</span>
  <span class="nd">@GeneratedValue</span>
  <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">getId</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">id</span><span class="o">;</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
  <span class="nd">@Temporal</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">TemporalType</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">TIMESTAMP</span><span class="o">)</span>
  <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="n">Date</span> <span class="nf">getDate</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">date</span><span class="o">;</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
  <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="n">Title</span> <span class="nf">getTitle</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">title</span><span class="o">;</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
  <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">setDate</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">Date</span> <span class="n">when</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="k">this</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">date</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">when</span><span class="o">;</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
  <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">setTitle</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">txt</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="k">this</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">title</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">txt</span><span class="o">;</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Before any operation with Hibernate, we have to create a session factory:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="n">SessionFactory</span> <span class="n">factory</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nf">AnnotationConfiguration</span><span class="o">()</span>
  <span class="o">.</span><span class="na">configure</span><span class="o">()</span>
  <span class="o">.</span><span class="na">addAnnotatedClass</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">Post</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">class</span><span class="o">)</span>
  <span class="o">.</span><span class="na">buildSessionFactory</span><span class="o">();</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This factory will give us &quot;sessions&quot; every time we want to manipulate
with <code>Post</code> objects. Every manipulation with the session should be wrapped
in this code block:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="n">Session</span> <span class="n">session</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">factory</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">openSession</span><span class="o">();</span>
<span class="k">try</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="n">Transaction</span> <span class="n">txn</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">session</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">beginTransaction</span><span class="o">();</span>
  <span class="c1">// your manipulations with the ORM, see below</span>
  <span class="n">txn</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">commit</span><span class="o">();</span>
<span class="o">}</span> <span class="k">catch</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">HibernateException</span> <span class="n">ex</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="n">txn</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">rollback</span><span class="o">();</span>
<span class="o">}</span> <span class="k">finally</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="n">session</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">close</span><span class="o">();</span>
<span class="o">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>When the session is ready, here is how we get a list of all posts
from that database table:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="n">List</span> <span class="n">posts</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">session</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">createQuery</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;FROM Post&quot;</span><span class="o">).</span><span class="na">list</span><span class="o">();</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">Post</span> <span class="n">post</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">List</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Post</span><span class="o">&gt;)</span> <span class="n">posts</span><span class="o">){</span>
  <span class="n">System</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">out</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">println</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Title: &quot;</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">post</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getTitle</span><span class="o">());</span>
<span class="o">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>I think it&#39;s clear what&#39;s going on here. Hibernate is a big, powerful
engine that makes a connection to the database, executes necessary SQL
<code>SELECT</code> requests, and retrieves the data. Then it makes instances
of class <code>Post</code> and stuffs them with the data.
When the object comes to us, it is filled with data, and we should
use getters to take them out, like we&#39;re using <code>getTitle()</code> above.</p>

<p>When we want to do a reverse operation and send an object to the
database, we do all of the same but in reverse order. We make an instance
of class <code>Post</code>, stuff it with the data, and ask Hibernate to save it:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="n">Post</span> <span class="n">post</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nf">Post</span><span class="o">();</span>
<span class="n">post</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">setDate</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="nf">Date</span><span class="o">());</span>
<span class="n">post</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">setTitle</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;How to cook an omelette&quot;</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">session</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">save</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">post</span><span class="o">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This is how almost every ORM works. The basic principle is always the same &mdash;
ORM objects are anemic envelopes with data. We are talking with the ORM
framework, and the framework is talking to the database. Objects only help
us send our requests to the ORM framework and understand its response.
Besides getters and setters, objects have no other methods. They don&#39;t even know
which database they came from.</p>

<p>This is how object-relational mapping works.</p>

<p>What&#39;s wrong with it, you may ask? Everything!</p>

<h2 id="what-39-s-wrong-with-orm">What&#39;s Wrong With ORM?</h2>

<p>Seriously, what is wrong? Hibernate has been one of the most popular Java libraries
for more than 10 years already. Almost every SQL-intensive application in the world
is using it. Each Java tutorial would mention Hibernate (or maybe
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_object-relational_mapping_software">some other ORM</a>
like TopLink or OpenJPA) for a database-connected application. It&#39;s a standard
<em>de-facto</em> and still I&#39;m saying that it&#39;s wrong? Yes.</p>

<p>I&#39;m claiming that the entire idea behind ORM is wrong. Its invention
was maybe the second big mistake in OOP after
<a href="/2014/05/13/why-null-is-bad.html">NULL reference</a>.</p>



<p>Actually, I&#39;m not the only one saying something like this, and
definitely not the first. A lot about
this subject has already been published by very respected authors, including
<a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/OrmHate.html">OrmHate</a> by Martin Fowler (not against ORM, but worth mentioning anyway),
<a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/object-relational-mapping-is-the-vietnam-of-computer-science/">Object-Relational Mapping Is the Vietnam of Computer Science</a> by Jeff Atwood,
<a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/2006/06/26/The+Vietnam+Of+Computer+Science.aspx">The Vietnam of Computer Science</a> by Ted Neward,
<a href="http://seldo.com/weblog/2011/08/11/orm_is_an_antipattern">ORM Is an Anti-Pattern</a> by Laurie Voss,
and many others.</p>

<p>However, my argument is different than what they&#39;re saying. Even though their reasons are
practical and valid, like &quot;ORM is slow&quot; or &quot;database upgrades are hard&quot;,
they miss the main point. You can see a very good, practical answer
to these practical arguments given by Bozhidar Bozhanov
in his <a href="http://techblog.bozho.net/orm-haters-dont-get-it/">ORM Haters Don’t Get It</a> blog post.</p>



<p>The main point is that ORM, instead of encapsulating database interaction
inside an object, extracts it away, literally tearing a solid and cohesive
<a href="/2014/11/20/seven-virtues-of-good-object.html">living organism</a> apart.
One part of the object keeps the data while another one, implemented inside
the ORM engine (session factory), knows how to deal with this data and transfers it to the
relational database. Look at this picture; it illustrates what ORM is doing.</p>

<p>I, being a reader of posts, have to deal with two components: 1) the ORM
and 2) the &quot;ob-truncated&quot; object returned to me. The behavior I&#39;m interacting
with is supposed to be provided through a single entry point, which is an object
in OOP. In the case of ORM, I&#39;m getting this behavior via <strong>two</strong> entry points &mdash;
the ORM engine and the &quot;thing&quot;, which we can&#39;t even call an object.</p>

<p>Because of this terrible and offensive violation of the object-oriented
paradigm, we have a lot of practical issues already mentioned in
respected publications. I can only add a few more.</p>

<p><strong>SQL Is Not Hidden</strong>.
Users of ORM should speak SQL
(or its dialect, like <a href="https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/3.3/reference/en/html/queryhql.html">HQL</a>).
See the example above; we&#39;re calling <code>session.createQuery(&quot;FROM Post&quot;)</code> in order
to get all posts. Even though it&#39;s not SQL, it is very similar to it. Thus,
the relational model is not encapsulated inside objects. Instead, it is exposed
to the entire application. Everybody, with each object, inevitably has to
deal with a relational model in order to get or save something. Thus,
ORM doesn&#39;t hide and wrap the SQL but pollutes the entire application with it.</p>

<p><strong>Difficult to Test</strong>.
When some object is working with a list of posts, it needs to deal with an
instance of <code>SessionFactory</code>. How can we
<a href="/2014/09/23/built-in-fake-objects.html">mock</a> this dependency? We have to
create a mock of it? How complex is this task? Look at the code above, and you
will realize how verbose and cumbersome that unit test will be. Instead,
we can write integration tests and connect the entire application to a test
version of PostgreSQL. In that case, there is no need to mock <code>SessionFactory</code>,
but such tests will be rather slow, and even more important, our
having-nothing-to-do-with-the-database objects will be tested against
the database instance. A terrible design.</p>

<p>Again, let me reiterate. Practical problems of ORM are just consequences. The
fundamental drawback is that ORM tears objects apart, terribly and offensively
violating the very idea of <a href="/2014/11/20/seven-virtues-of-good-object.html">what an object is</a>.</p>

<h2 id="sql-speaking-objects">SQL-Speaking Objects</h2>



<p>What is the alternative? Let me show it to you by example. Let&#39;s try to design that
class, <code>Post</code>, my way. We&#39;ll have to break it down into two classes: <code>Post</code>
and <code>Posts</code>, singular and plural. I already mentioned in one of my previous
<a href="/2014/11/20/seven-virtues-of-good-object.html">articles</a> that
a good object is always an abstraction of a real-life entity. Here is how
this principle works in practice. We have two entities: database table
and table row. That&#39;s why we&#39;ll make two classes; <code>Posts</code> will represent the
table, and <code>Post</code> will represent the row.</p>

<p>As I also mentioned in that <a href="/2014/11/20/seven-virtues-of-good-object.html">article</a>,
every object should work by contract
and implement an interface. Let&#39;s start our design with two
<a href="/2016/04/26/why-inputstream-design-is-wrong.html">interfaces</a>.
Of course, our objects will be
<a href="/2014/12/22/immutable-objects-not-dumb.html">immutable</a>.
Here is how <code>Posts</code> would look:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="kd">interface</span> <span class="nc">Posts</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="n">Iterable</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Post</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nf">iterate</span><span class="o">();</span>
  <span class="n">Post</span> <span class="nf">add</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">Date</span> <span class="n">date</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">title</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="o">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This is how a single <code>Post</code> would look:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="kd">interface</span> <span class="nc">Post</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">id</span><span class="o">();</span>
  <span class="n">Date</span> <span class="nf">date</span><span class="o">();</span>
  <span class="n">String</span> <span class="nf">title</span><span class="o">();</span>
<span class="o">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Here is how we will list all posts in the database table:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="n">Posts</span> <span class="n">posts</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="c1">// we&#39;ll discuss this right now</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">Post</span> <span class="n">post</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">posts</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">iterate</span><span class="o">()){</span>
  <span class="n">System</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">out</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">println</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Title: &quot;</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">post</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">title</span><span class="o">());</span>
<span class="o">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Here is how we will create a new post:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="n">Posts</span> <span class="n">posts</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="c1">// we&#39;ll discuss this right now</span>
<span class="n">posts</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">add</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="nf">Date</span><span class="o">(),</span> <span class="s">&quot;How to cook an omelette&quot;</span><span class="o">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>As you see, we have true objects now. They are in charge of all operations,
and they perfectly hide their implementation details. There are no transactions,
sessions, or factories. We don&#39;t even know whether these objects are actually
talking to the PostgreSQL or if they keep all the data in text files. All
we need from <code>Posts</code> is an ability to list all posts for us and to create
a new one. Implementation details are perfectly hidden inside. Now let&#39;s
see how we can implement these two classes.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to use <a href="http://jdbc.jcabi.com">jcabi-jdbc</a> as a JDBC wrapper,
but you can use something else or just plain JDBC if you like. It doesn&#39;t
really matter. What matters is that your database interactions are hidden
inside objects. Let&#39;s start with <code>Posts</code> and implement it in class
<code>PgPosts</code> (&quot;pg&quot; stands for PostgreSQL):</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="kd">final</span> <span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">PgPosts</span> <span class="kd">implements</span> <span class="n">Posts</span> <span class="o">{</span>

<p>Next, let&#39;s implement the <code>Post</code> interface in class <code>PgPost</code>:</p>

  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This is how a full database interaction scenario would look like
using the classes we just created:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="n">Posts</span> <span class="n">posts</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nf">PgPosts</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">dbase</span><span class="o">);</span>

<p>You can see a full practical example <a href="https://github.com/aintshy/hub/tree/0.7.2/src/main/java/com/aintshy/pgsql">here</a>.
It&#39;s an open source
web app that works with PostgreSQL using the exact approach explained
above &mdash; SQL-speaking objects.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-performance">What About Performance?</h2>

<p>I can hear you screaming, &quot;What about performance?&quot; In that script
a few lines above, we&#39;re making many redundant round trips to the database.
First, we retrieve post IDs with <code>SELECT id</code> and then, in order to get their titles,
we make an extra <code>SELECT title</code> call for each post. This is inefficient, or simply
put, too slow.</p>

<p>No worries; this is object-oriented programming, which means it is flexible! Let&#39;s create
a decorator of <code>PgPost</code> that will accept all data in its constructor
and cache it internally, forever:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="kd">final</span> <span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">ConstPost</span> <span class="kd">implements</span> <span class="n">Post</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="kd">private</span> <span class="kd">final</span> <span class="n">Post</span> <span class="n">origin</span><span class="o">;</span>
  <span class="kd">private</span> <span class="kd">final</span> <span class="n">Date</span> <span class="n">dte</span><span class="o">;</span>
  <span class="kd">private</span> <span class="kd">final</span> <span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">ttl</span><span class="o">;</span>
  <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="nf">ConstPost</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">Post</span> <span class="n">post</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">Date</span> <span class="n">date</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">title</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="k">this</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">origin</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">post</span><span class="o">;</span>
    <span class="k">this</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">dte</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">date</span><span class="o">;</span>
    <span class="k">this</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">ttl</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">title</span><span class="o">;</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
  <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">id</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">origin</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">id</span><span class="o">();</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
  <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="n">Date</span> <span class="nf">date</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">dte</span><span class="o">;</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
  <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="n">String</span> <span class="nf">title</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">ttl</span><span class="o">;</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Pay attention: This decorator doesn&#39;t know anything about PostgreSQL or
JDBC. It just decorates an object of type <code>Post</code> and pre-caches the date
and title. As usual, this decorator is also immutable.</p>

<p>Now let&#39;s create another implementation of <code>Posts</code> that will return
the &quot;constant&quot; objects:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="kd">final</span> <span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">ConstPgPosts</span> <span class="kd">implements</span> <span class="n">Posts</span> <span class="o">{</span>

        <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">ListOutcome</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Post</span><span class="o">&gt;(</span>
          <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">ListOutcome</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">Mapping</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Post</span><span class="o">&gt;()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
            <span class="nd">@Override</span>
            <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="n">Post</span> <span class="nf">map</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="kd">final</span> <span class="n">ResultSet</span> <span class="n">rset</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
              <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nf">ConstPost</span><span class="o">(</span>
                <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nf">PgPost</span><span class="o">(</span>

                  <span class="n">rset</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getInteger</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">)</span>
                <span class="o">),</span>
                <span class="n">Utc</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getTimestamp</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">rset</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">),</span>
                <span class="n">rset</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getString</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="o">)</span>
              <span class="o">);</span>
            <span class="o">}</span>
          <span class="o">}</span>
        <span class="o">)</span>
      <span class="o">);</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now all posts returned by <code>iterate()</code> of this new class are pre-equipped with dates and titles
fetched in one round trip to the database.</p>

<p>Using <a href="/2015/02/26/composable-decorators.html">decorators</a>
and multiple implementations of the same interface, you
can compose any functionality you wish. What is the most important is that
while functionality is being extended, the complexity of the design is
not escalating, because classes don&#39;t grow in size. Instead, we&#39;re introducing
new classes that stay cohesive and solid, because they are small.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-transactions">What About Transactions?</h2>

<p>Every object should deal with its own transactions and encapsulate
them the same way as <code>SELECT</code> or <code>INSERT</code> queries. This will lead to
nested transactions, which is perfectly fine provided the database
server supports them. If there is no such support, create a session-wide
transaction object that will accept a &quot;callable&quot; class. For example:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="kd">final</span> <span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">Txn</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="kd">private</span> <span class="kd">final</span> <span class="n">DataSource</span> <span class="n">dbase</span><span class="o">;</span>
  <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">T</span> <span class="nf">call</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">Callable</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">callable</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="n">JdbcSession</span> <span class="n">session</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nf">JdbcSession</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">dbase</span><span class="o">);</span>
    <span class="k">try</span> <span class="o">{</span>
      <span class="n">session</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">sql</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;START TRANSACTION&quot;</span><span class="o">).</span><span class="na">exec</span><span class="o">();</span>
      <span class="n">T</span> <span class="n">result</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">callable</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">call</span><span class="o">();</span>
      <span class="n">session</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">sql</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;COMMIT&quot;</span><span class="o">).</span><span class="na">exec</span><span class="o">();</span>
      <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">result</span><span class="o">;</span>
    <span class="o">}</span> <span class="k">catch</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">Exception</span> <span class="n">ex</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
      <span class="n">session</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">sql</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;ROLLBACK&quot;</span><span class="o">).</span><span class="na">exec</span><span class="o">();</span>
      <span class="k">throw</span> <span class="n">ex</span><span class="o">;</span>
    <span class="o">}</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Then, when you want to wrap a few object manipulations in one
transaction, do it like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="k">new</span> <span class="nf">Txn</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">dbase</span><span class="o">).</span><span class="na">call</span><span class="o">(</span>
  <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">Callable</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Integer</span><span class="o">&gt;()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="nd">@Override</span>
    <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="n">Integer</span> <span class="nf">call</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
      <span class="n">Posts</span> <span class="n">posts</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nf">PgPosts</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">dbase</span><span class="o">);</span>
      <span class="n">Post</span> <span class="n">post</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">posts</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">add</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="nf">Date</span><span class="o">(),</span> <span class="s">&quot;How to cook an omelette&quot;</span><span class="o">);</span>
      <span class="n">posts</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">comments</span><span class="o">().</span><span class="na">post</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;This is my first comment!&quot;</span><span class="o">);</span>
      <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">post</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">id</span><span class="o">();</span>
    <span class="o">}</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This code will create a new post and post a comment to it. If one
of the calls fail, the entire transaction will be rolled back.</p>

<p>This approach looks object-oriented to me. I&#39;m calling it &quot;SQL-speaking objects&quot;,
because they know how to speak SQL with the database server. It&#39;s their
skill, perfectly encapsulated inside their borders.</p>
