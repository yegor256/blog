        its original content can be found

      <h1>How Much Your Objects Encapsulate?</h1>
      <p>Which line do you like more, the first or the second:</p>



<p>What is the difference? The first class <code>HTTP</code> encapsulates a URL,
while the second one expects it as an argument of method <code>read()</code>. Technically,
both objects do exactly the same thing: they read the content of the Google home page.
Which one is the right design? Usually I hate to say this, but in
this case I have to—it depends.</p>





<p>As <a href="/2014/11/20/seven-virtues-of-good-object.html">we discussed before</a>,
a good object is a representative of a real-life entity. Such an entity
exists outside of the object's living environment. The
<a href="/2016/07/14/who-is-object.html">object</a> knows
how to access it and how to communicate with it.</p>

<p>What is that real-life entity in the example above? Each class
gives its own answer. And the answer is given by the list
of arguments its constructors accept. The first class accepts
a single URL as an argument of its constructor. This tells us
that the object of this class, after being constructed, will represent
a web page. The second class accepts no arguments, which tells us
that the object of it will represent ... the Universe.</p>



<p>I think this principle is applicable to all classes in
object-oriented programming—in order to understand what
real-life entity an object represents, look at its constructor. All
arguments passed into the constructor and encapsulated by the object identify
a real-life entity accessed and managed by the object.</p>

<p>Of course, I'm talking about
<a href="/2014/11/20/seven-virtues-of-good-object.html">good objects</a>,
which are immutable and
<a href="/2014/09/16/getters-and-setters-are-evil.html">don't have setters and getters</a>.</p>

<p>Pay attention that I'm talking about arguments encapsulated by the object. The
following class doesn't represent the Universe, even though it does have
a no-arguments constructor:</p>



<p>This class has two constructors. One of them is the main one, and one is
supplementary. We're interested in the main one, which implements
the <a href="/2016/11/21/naked-data.html"><em>encapsulation</em></a> of arguments.</p>

<p>Now, the question is which is better: to represent a web page
or the Universe? It depends, but I think that in general, the smaller the
real-life entity we represent, the more solid and cohesive design
we give to the object.</p>

<p>On the other hand, sometimes we have to have an object that represents
the Universe. For example, we may have this:</p>



<p>This is not an elegant design, but it demonstrates when it may be
necessary to represent the entire Universe. An object of this <code>HTTP</code> class can read
any web page from the entire web (it is almost as big as the Universe, isn't it?),
and it can check whether the entire web is accessible by it. Obviously,
in this case, we don't need it to encapsulate anything.</p>

<p>I believe that objects representing the Universe are not good objects,
mostly because there is only one Universe; why do we need many
representatives of it? :)</p>
