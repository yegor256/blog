      <h1>Objects Should Be Immutable</h1>
      <p>In object-oriented programming, an object is
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object">immutable</a> if its state can’t be
modified after it is created.
In Java, a good example of an
immutable <a href="/2016/07/14/who-is-object.html">object</a>
is <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html"><code>String</code></a>.
Once created, we can’t modify its state. We can request that it creates
new strings, but its own state will never change.</p>



<p>However, there are not so many immutable classes in JDK. Take,
for example, class <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Date.html"><code>Date</code></a>.
It is possible to modify its state using <code>setTime()</code>.</p>



<p>I don’t know why the JDK designers decided to make these two
very similar classes differently. However, I believe that the design
of a mutable <code>Date</code> has many flaws, while the immutable <code>String</code>
is much more in the spirit of the object-oriented paradigm.</p>

<p>Moreover, I think that <strong>all classes should be immutable in
a perfect object-oriented world</strong>. Unfortunately, sometimes,
it is technically not possible due to limitations in JVM.
Nevertheless, we should always aim for the best.</p>

<p>This is an incomplete list of arguments in favor of immutability:</p>

<ul>
  <li>immutable objects are simpler to construct, test, and use</li>
  <li>truly immutable objects are always thread-safe</li>
  <li>they help to avoid <a href="/2015/12/08/temporal-coupling-between-method-calls.html">temporal coupling</a>
</li>
  <li>their usage is side-effect free (no defensive copies)</li>
  <li>identity mutability problem is avoided</li>
  <li>they always have failure atomicity</li>
  <li>they are much easier to cache</li>
  <li>they prevent NULL references, <a href="/2014/05/13/why-null-is-bad.html">which are bad</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s discuss the most important arguments one by one.</p>

<h2 id="thread-safety">Thread Safety</h2>

<p>The first and the most obvious argument is that immutable objects
are thread-safe. This means that multiple threads can access the same
object at the same time, without clashing with another thread.</p>



<p>If no object methods can modify its state, no matter how many
of them and how often are being called parallel—they
will work in their own memory space in stack.</p>

<p>Goetz et al. explained the advantages of immutable objects
in more details in their very famous book
<a href="http://amzn.to/2bQVqBr">Java Concurrency in Practice</a>
(highly recommended).</p>

<h2 id="avoiding-temporal-coupling">Avoiding Temporal Coupling</h2>

<p>Here is an example of temporal coupling (the code makes
two consecutive HTTP POST requests, where the second one contains HTTP body):</p>

<pre>Request request = new Request("http://localhost");
request.method("POST");
String first = request.fetch();
request.body("text=hello");
String second = request.fetch();</pre>

<p>This code works. However, you must remember that the first
request should be configured before the second one may happen.
If we decide to remove the first request from the script, we will
remove the second and the third line, and won’t get any errors
from the compiler:</p>

<pre>Request request = new Request("http://localhost");
// request.method("POST");
// String first = request.fetch();
request.body("text=hello");
String second = request.fetch();</pre>

<p>Now, the script is broken although it compiled without errors. This is
what <a href="/2015/12/08/temporal-coupling-between-method-calls.html">temporal coupling</a>
is about—there is always some hidden
information in the code that a programmer has to remember. In this example,
we have to remember that the configuration for the first request
is also used for the second one.</p>



<p>We have to remember that the second request should always stay
together and be executed after the first one.</p>

<p>If <code>Request</code> class were immutable, the first snippet wouldn’t
work in the first place, and would have been rewritten like:</p>

<pre>final Request request = new Request("");
String first = request.method("POST").fetch();
String second = request.method("POST").body("text=hello").fetch();</pre>

<p>Now, these two requests are not coupled. We can safely remove
the first one, and the second one will still work correctly.
You may point out that there is a code duplication. Yes, we
should get rid of it and re-write the code:</p>

<pre>final Request request = new Request("");
final Request post = request.method("POST");
String first = post.fetch();
String second = post.body("text=hello").fetch();</pre>

<p>See, refactoring didn’t break anything and we still don’t have
temporal coupling. The first request can be removed safely
from the code without affecting the second one.</p>

<p>I hope this example demonstrates that the code manipulating
immutable objects is more readable and maintainable,
because it doesn’t have
<a href="/2015/12/08/temporal-coupling-between-method-calls.html">temporal coupling</a>.</p>

<h2 id="avoiding-side-effects">Avoiding Side Effects</h2>

<p>Let’s try to use our <code>Request</code> class in a new method (now it is mutable):</p>

<pre>public String post(Request request) {
  request.method("POST");
  return request.fetch();
}</pre>

<p>Let’s try to make two requests—the first
with GET method and the second with POST:</p>

<pre>Request request = new Request("http://localhost");
request.method("GET");
String first = this.post(request);
String second = request.fetch();</pre>

<p>Method <code>post()</code> has a “side effect”—it makes changes
to the mutable object <code>request</code>. These changes are not really
expected in this case. We expect it to make a POST request and
return its body. We don’t want to read its documentation just
to find out that behind the scene it also modifies
the request we’re passing to it as an argument.</p>

<p>Needless to say, such side effects lead to bugs and
maintainability issues. It would be much better
to work with an immutable <code>Request</code>:</p>

<pre>public String post(Request request) {
  return request.method("POST").fetch();
}</pre>

<p>In this case, we may not have any side effects.
Nobody can modify our <code>request</code> object, no matter where
it is used and how deep through the call stack it is passed by method calls:</p>

<pre>Request request = new Request("http://localhost").method("GET");
String first = this.post(request);
String second = request.fetch();</pre>

<p>This code is perfectly safe and side effect free.</p>

<h2 id="avoiding-identity-mutability">Avoiding Identity Mutability</h2>

<p>Very often, we want objects to be identical if their internal
states are the same. <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Date.html"><code>Date</code></a>
class is a good example:</p>

<pre>Date first = new Date(1L);
Date second = new Date(1L);
assert first.equals(second); // true</pre>

<p>There are two different objects; however, they are equal
to each other because their encapsulated states are the same.
This is made possible through their custom overloaded
implementation of <code>equals()</code> and <code>hashCode()</code> methods.</p>

<p>The consequence of this convenient approach being used
with mutable objects is that every time we modify
object’s state it changes its identity:</p>

<pre>Date first = new Date(1L);
Date second = new Date(1L);
first.setTime(2L);
assert first.equals(second); // false</pre>

<p>This may look natural, until you start using your
mutable objects as keys in maps:</p>

<pre>Map&lt;Date, String&gt; map = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();
Date date = new Date();
map.put(date, "hello, world!");
date.setTime(12345L);
assert map.containsKey(date); // false</pre>

<p>When modifying the state of <code>date</code> object, we’re not expecting
it to change its identity. We’re not expecting to lose an entry
in the map just because the state of its key is changed. However,
this is exactly what is happening in the example above.</p>



<p>When we add an object to the map, its <code>hashCode()</code> returns one value.
This value is used by <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html"><code>HashMap</code></a>
to place the entry into the internal hash table.
When we call <code>containsKey()</code> hash code of the object is
different (because it is based on its internal state) and
<code>HashMap</code> can’t find it in the internal hash table.</p>

<p>It is a very annoying and difficult to debug
side effects of mutable objects. Immutable objects avoid it completely.</p>

<h2 id="failure-atomicity">Failure Atomicity</h2>

<p>Here is a simple example:</p>

<pre>public class Stack {
  private int size;
  private String[] items;
  public void push(String item) {
    size++;
    if (size &gt; items.length) {
      throw new RuntimeException("stack overflow");
    }
    items[size] = item;
  }
}</pre>

<p>It is obvious that an object of class <code>Stack</code> will be left
in a broken state if it
<a href="/2015/12/01/rethrow-exceptions.html">throws</a>
a runtime exception on overflow.
Its <code>size</code> property will be incremented, while <code>items</code> won’t get a new element.</p>



<p>Immutability prevents this problem. An object will never be
left in a broken state because its state is modified only in
its constructor. The constructor will either fail, rejecting
object instantiation, or succeed, making a valid solid object,
which never changes its encapsulated state.</p>

<a href="http://amzn.to/2cs4aiR">Effective Java, 2nd Edition</a>
by Joshua Bloch.</p>

<h2 id="arguments-against-immutability">Arguments Against Immutability</h2>

<p>There are a number of arguments against immutability.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>“Immutability is not for enterprise systems”.
Very often, I hear people say that immutability is a
fancy feature, while absolutely impractical in real
enterprise systems. As a counter-argument, I can only show
some examples of real-life applications that contain only immutable Java objects:
<a href="http://http.jcabi.com"><code>jcabi-http</code></a>,
<a href="/2014/04/24/java-xml-parsing-and-traversing.html"><code>jcabi-xml</code></a>,
<a href="/2014/05/14/object-oriented-github-java-sdk.html"><code>jcabi-github</code></a>,
<a href="/2014/05/26/amazon-s3-java-oop-adapter.html"><code>jcabi-s3</code></a>,
<a href="/2014/04/14/jcabi-dynamo-java-api-of-aws-dynamodb.html"><code>jcabi-dynamo</code></a>,
<a href="/2014/04/29/w3c-java-validators.html"><code>jcabi-w3c</code></a>,
<a href="/2014/08/18/fluent-jdbc-decorator.html"><code>jcabi-jdbc</code></a>,
<a href="http://simpledb.jcabi.com"><code>jcabi-simpledb</code></a>,
<a href="/2014/09/02/java-ssh-client.html"><code>jcabi-ssh</code></a>.
The above are all Java libraries that work solely with immutable
classes/objects. <a href="https://github.com/netbout/netbout">netbout.com</a>
and <a href="/2014/12/04/synchronization-between-nodes.html">stateful.co</a> are
web applications that work solely with immutable objects.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“It’s cheaper to update an existing object than create a new one”.
Oracle <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/immutable.html">thinks</a>
that “The impact of object creation is often overestimated and can
be offset by some of the efficiency associated with immutable objects.
These include decreased overhead due to garbage collection, and the
elimination of code needed to protect mutable objects from corruption.” I agree.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>If you have some other arguments, please post them below and I’ll try to comment.</p>

<p>P.S. Check <a href="http://www.takes.org">takes.org</a>,
a Java web framework that consists entirely of immutable objects.</p>
