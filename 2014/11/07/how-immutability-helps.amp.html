      <h1>How Immutability Helps</h1>
      <p>In a few recent posts, including
<a href="/2014/09/16/getters-and-setters-are-evil.html">"Getters/Setters. Evil. Period."</a>,
<a href="/2014/06/09/objects-should-be-immutable.html">"Objects Should Be Immutable"</a>, and
<a href="/2014/10/03/di-containers-are-evil.html">"Dependency Injection Containers are Code Polluters"</a>,
I universally labeled all mutable objects with "setters" (object methods starting with <code>set</code>) evil.
My argumentation was based mostly on metaphors and abstract examples. Apparently,
this wasn't convincing enough for many of you — I received a few requests
asking to provide more specific and practical examples.</p>

<p>Thus, in order to illustrate my strongly negative attitude to "mutability via setters", I took
an existing <a href="http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-email/">commons-email</a> Java library from Apache
and re-designed it my way, without setters and with "object thinking" in mind.
I released my library as part of the <a href="http://www.jcabi.com">jcabi</a> family
— <a href="http://email.jcabi.com">jcabi-email</a>. Let's see what benefits
we get from a "pure" object-oriented and immutable approach, without getters.</p>



<p>Here is how your code will look, if you send an email using commons-email:</p>



<p>Here is how you do the same with <a href="http://email.jcabi.com">jcabi-email</a>:</p>



<p>I think the difference is obvious.</p>

<p>In the first example, you're
dealing with a monster
<a href="/2016/09/20/oop-without-classes.html">class</a> that can do everything for you, including
sending your MIME message via SMTP, creating the message, configuring
its parameters, adding MIME parts to it, etc. The
<a href="http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/commons/proper/email/tags/EMAIL_1_3_3/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/mail/Email.java?revision=1609295&amp;view=co"><code>Email</code></a>
class from commons-email is really a huge class — 33 private properties, over
a hundred methods, about two thousands lines of code. First, you configure
the class through a bunch of setters and then you ask it to <code>send()</code>
an email for you.</p>

<p>In the second example, we have seven objects instantiated via seven <code>new</code> calls.
<code>Postman</code> is responsible for packaging a MIME message; <code>SMTP</code> is
responsible for sending it via SMTP; stamps (<code>StSender</code>, <code>StRecipient</code>,
and <code>StSubject</code>) are responsible for configuring the MIME message before
delivery; enclosure <code>EnPlain</code> is responsible for creating a MIME part
for the message we're going to send. We construct these seven objects,
encapsulating one into another, and then we ask the postman to <code>send()</code>
the envelope for us.</p>

<h2 id="what-39-s-wrong-with-a-mutable-email">What's Wrong With a Mutable Email?</h2>

<p>From a user perspective, there is almost nothing wrong. <code>Email</code> is a powerful
class with multiple controls — just hit the right one and the job
gets done. However, from a developer perspective <code>Email</code> class is a nightmare. Mostly
because the class is very big and difficult to maintain.</p>

<p><em>Because the class is so big</em>,
every time you want to extend it by introducing a new method, you're facing the fact that you're
making the class even worse — longer, less cohesive, less readable,
less maintainable, etc. You have a feeling that you're digging into something
dirty and that there is no hope to make it cleaner, ever. I'm sure, you're
familiar with this feeling — most legacy applications look that way.
They have huge multi-line "classes" (in reality, COBOL programs written in Java)
that were inherited from a few generations of programmers before you. When
you start, you're full of energy, but after a few minutes of scrolling
such a "class" you say — "screw it, it's almost Saturday".</p>

<p><em>Because the class is so big</em>,
there is no data hiding or encapsulation any more
— 33 variables are accessible by over 100 methods. What is hidden?
This <code>Email.java</code> file in reality is a big, procedural 2000-line script, called
a "class" by mistake. Nothing is hidden, once you cross the border of the
class by calling one of its methods. After that, you have full access to
all the data you may need. Why is this bad? Well, why do we need encapsulation
in the first place? In order to protect one programmer from another, aka
<a href="/2016/01/26/defensive-programming.html">defensive programming</a>.
While I'm busy changing the subject of the MIME message, I want to be
sure that I'm not interfered with by some other method's activity, that is
changing a sender and touching my subject by mistake. Encapsulation helps
us narrow down the scope of the problem, while this <code>Email</code> class
is doing exactly the opposite.</p>

<p><em>Because the class is so big</em>,
its unit testing is even more complicated than the class itself. Why? Because
of multiple inter-dependencies between its methods and properties. In order to
test <code>setCharset()</code> you have to prepare the entire object by calling a few other
methods, then you have to call <code>send()</code> to make sure the message being
sent actually uses the encoding you specified. Thus, in order to test
a one-line method <code>setCharset()</code> you run the entire integration testing
scenario of sending a full MIME message through SMTP. Obviously, if something
gets changed in one of the methods, almost every test method will be
affected. In other words, tests are very fragile, unreliable and over-complicated.</p>

<p>I can go on and on with this "<em>because the class is so big</em>", but I think it is
obvious that a small, cohesive class is always better than a big one. It
is obvious to me, to you, and to any object-oriented programmer. But why is it not
so obvious to the developers of Apache Commons Email? I don't think they are
stupid or un-educated. What is it then?</p>

<h2 id="how-and-why-did-it-happen">How and Why Did It Happen?</h2>

<p>This is how it always happens. You start to design a class as something
cohesive, solid, and small. Your intentions are very positive.
Very soon you realize that there is something
else that this class has to do. Then, something else. Then, even more.</p>

<p>The best way to make your class more and more powerful is by adding
setters that inject configuration parameters into the class so that it
can process them inside, isn't it?</p>

<p>This is the root cause of the problem! The root cause is our ability to <strong>insert</strong>
data into mutable objects via configuration methods, also known as "setters".
When an <a href="/2016/07/14/who-is-object.html">object</a>
is mutable and allows us to add setters whenever we
want, we will do it without limits.</p>

<p>Let me put it this way —
<strong>mutable classes tend to grow in size and lose cohesiveness</strong>.</p>

<p>If commons-email authors made this <code>Email</code> class immutable
in the beginning, they wouldn't have been able to add so many methods into it
and encapsulate so many properties. They wouldn't be able to turn
it into a monster. Why? Because an immutable object only accepts a state
through a constructor. Can you imagine a 33-argument constructor?
Of course, not.</p>

<p>When you make your class immutable in the first place, you are forced
to keep it cohesive, small, solid and robust. Because you can't encapsulate
too much and you can't modify what's encapsulated. Just two or three
arguments of a constructor and you're done.</p>

<h2 id="how-did-i-design-an-immutable-email">How Did I Design An Immutable Email?</h2>



<p>When I was designing <a href="https://github.com/jcabi/jcabi-email">jcabi-email</a>
I started with a small and simple class:
<a href="https://github.com/jcabi/jcabi-email/blob/1.3/src/main/java/com/jcabi/email/Postman.java"><code>Postman</code></a>.
Well, it is an interface,
since I never make <a href="/2016/04/26/why-inputstream-design-is-wrong.html">interface</a>-less
classes. So, <code>Postman</code> is... a post man.
He is delivering messages to other people. First, I created a default
version of it (I omit the ctor, for the sake of brevity):</p>



<p>Good start, it works. What now? Well, the
<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/jms/Message.html"><code>Message</code></a>
is difficult to construct.
It is a complex class from JDK that requires some manipulations before it
can become a nice HTML email. So I created an envelope, which will build
this complex object for me (pay attention, both
<a href="https://github.com/jcabi/jcabi-email/blob/1.3/src/main/java/com/jcabi/email/Postman.java"><code>Postman</code></a> and
<a href="https://github.com/jcabi/jcabi-email/blob/1.3/src/main/java/com/jcabi/email/Envelope.java"><code>Envelope</code></a>
are immutable and annotated with
<a href="http://aspects.jcabi.com/apidocs-0.20/com/jcabi/aspects/Immutable.html">@Immutable</a> from
<a href="http://aspects.jcabi.com/annotation-immutable.html">jcabi-aspects</a>):</p>



<p>I also refactor the <code>Postman</code> to accept an envelope, not a message:</p>



<p>So far, so good. Now let's try to create a simple implementation of
<code>Envelope</code>:</p>



<p>It works, but it does nothing useful yet. It only creates an absolutely
empty MIME message and returns it. How about adding a subject to it
and both <code>To:</code> and <code>From:</code> addresses (pay attention, <code>MIME</code> class is
also immutable):</p>



<p>Looks correct and it works. But it is still too primitive. How about
<code>CC:</code> and <code>BCC:</code>? What about email text? How about PDF enclosures?
What if I want to specify the encoding of the message? What about <code>Reply-To</code>?</p>

<p>Can I add all these parameters to the constructor? Remember, the
class is immutable and I can't introduce the <code>setReplyTo()</code> method. I have to
pass the <code>replyTo</code> argument into its constructor. It's impossible, because
the constructor will have too many arguments, and nobody will be able to use it.</p>

<p>So, what do I do?</p>

<p>Well, I started to think: how can we break the concept of an "envelope"
into smaller concepts — and this what I invented. Like a real-life envelope,
my <code>MIME</code> object will have stamps. Stamps will be responsible
for configuring an object <code>Message</code> (again,
<a href="https://github.com/jcabi/jcabi-email/blob/1.3/src/main/java/com/jcabi/email/Stamp.java"><code>Stamp</code></a> is immutable,
as well as all its implementers):</p>



<p>Now, I can simplify my
<a href="https://github.com/jcabi/jcabi-email/blob/1.3/src/main/java/com/jcabi/email/Envelope.java"><code>MIME</code></a> class to the following:</p>



<p>Now, I will create stamps for the subject, for <code>To:</code>, for <code>From:</code>,
for <code>CC:</code>, for <code>BCC:</code>, etc. As many stamps as I like. The class <code>MIME</code>
will stay the same — small, cohesive, readable, solid, etc.</p>

<p>What is important here is why I made the decision to refactor while
the class was relatively small. Indeed, I started to worry about these
stamp classes when my <code>MIME</code> class was just 25 lines in size.</p>

<p>That is exactly the point of this article —
<strong>immutability forces you to design small and cohesive objects</strong>.</p>

<p>Without immutability, I would have gone the same direction as commons-email. My
<code>MIME</code> class would grow in size and sooner or later would become
as big as <code>Email</code> from commons-email. The only thing that stopped me
was the necessity to refactor it, because I wasn't able to pass all
arguments through a constructor.</p>

<p>Without immutability, I wouldn't have had that motivator and I would
have done what Apache developers did with commons-email — bloat the
class and turn it into an unmaintainable monster.</p>

<p>That's <a href="http://email.jcabi.com">jcabi-email</a>. I hope
this example was illustrative enough and that you will start writing
cleaner code with immutable objects.</p>
