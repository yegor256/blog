      <h1>Seven Virtues of a Good Object</h1>
      <p>Martin Fowler <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/InversionOfControl.html">says</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A library is essentially a set of functions that you can call,
these days usually organized into classes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Functions organized into classes? With all due respect, this is wrong. And it
is a very common misconception of a class in object-oriented programming. Classes
are not organizers of functions. And objects are not data structures.</p>

<p>So what is a “proper” object? Which one is not a proper one?
What is the difference? Even though it is a very polemic subject, it is very important.
Unless we understand what an object is, how can we write object-oriented software?
Well, thanks to Java, Ruby, and others, we can. But how good will it be?
Unfortunately, this is not an exact science, and there are many opinions.
Here is my list of qualities of a good object.</p>



<h2 id="class-vs-object">Class vs. Object</h2>



<p>Before we start talking about <a href="/2016/07/14/who-is-object.html">objects</a>,
let’s define what a <em>class</em> is. It
is a place where objects are being born (a.k.a. <em>instantiated</em>). The main
<a href="/2016/08/30/decomposition-of-responsibility.html">responsibility</a>
of a class is to <em>construct</em> new objects on demand and <em>destruct</em> them when
they are not used anymore. A class knows how its children should look
and how they should behave. In other words, it knows what <em>contracts</em> they should obey.</p>



<p>Sometimes I hear classes being called “object templates”
(for example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_%28computer_programming%29">Wikipedia says so</a>).
This definition is not correct because it places classes into a passive position. This definition
assumes that someone will get a template and build an object by using it.
This may be true, technically speaking, but conceptually it’s wrong. Nobody else
should be involved—there are only a class and its children. An
object asks a class to create another object, and the class constructs it; that’s it.
Ruby expresses this concept much better than Java or C++:</p>

<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">photo</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nc">File</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">new</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="err">'</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">tmp</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">photo</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">png</span><span class="err">'</span><span class="o">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The object <code class="highlighter-rouge">photo</code> is constructed by the class <code class="highlighter-rouge">File</code> (<code class="highlighter-rouge">new</code> is an entry point to the class).
Once constructed, the object is acting on its own. It shouldn’t know who constructed it
and how many more brothers and sisters it has in the class. Yes, I mean
that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_%28computer_programming%29">reflection</a>
is a terrible idea, but I’ll write more about it in one of the next posts :)
Now, let’s talk about objects and their best and worst sides.</p>

<h2 id="1-he-exists-in-real-life">1. He Exists in Real Life</h2>



<p>First of all, an object is a <strong>living organism</strong>. Moreover, an object
should be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphism">anthropomorphized</a>, i.e.
treated like a human being (or a pet, if you like them more). By this
I basically mean that an object is not a <em>data structure</em> or a collection
of functions. Instead, it is an independent entity with its own life cycle,
its own behavior, and its own habits.</p>

<p>An employee, a department, an HTTP request, a table in MySQL,
a line in a file, or a file itself are proper objects—because they exist in
real life, even when our software is turned off. To be more precise, an object is a
<em>representative</em> of a real-life creature. It is a <em>proxy</em> of that
real-life creature in front of all other objects. Without
such a creature, there is—obviously—no object.</p>

<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">photo</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nc">File</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">new</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="err">'</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">tmp</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">photo</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">png</span><span class="err">'</span><span class="o">)</span>
<span class="n">puts</span> <span class="n">photo</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">width</span><span class="o">()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this example, I’m asking <code class="highlighter-rouge">File</code> to construct a new object <code class="highlighter-rouge">photo</code>, which will
be a representative of a real file on disk. You may say that a file
is also something virtual and exists only when the computer is turned on.
I would agree and refine the definition of “real life” as follows: It is
everything that exists aside from the scope of the program the object
lives in. The disk file is outside the scope of our program; that’s why
it is perfectly correct to create its representative inside the program.</p>

<p>A controller, a parser, a filter, a validator, a service locator,
a singleton, or a factory are <strong>not</strong> good objects
(yes, most GoF patterns are
<a href="/2016/02/03/design-patterns-and-anti-patterns.html">anti-patterns</a>!).
They don’t exist apart from your software, in real life. They
are invented just to tie other objects together. They are artificial
and fake creatures. They don’t represent anyone. Seriously, an XML parser—who does it represent? Nobody.</p>

<p>Some of them may become good if they change their names;
others can never excuse their existence. For example, that XML parser can be
renamed to “parseable XML” and start to represent an XML document
that exists outside of our scope.</p>

<p>Always ask yourself, “What is
the real-life entity behind my object?” If you can’t find an answer,
start thinking about refactoring.</p>

<h2 id="2-he-works-by-contracts">2. He Works by Contracts</h2>



<p>A good object always works by contracts. He expects to be hired not
because of his personal merits but because he obeys the contracts. On the
other hand, when we hire an object, we shouldn’t discriminate and expect some specific
object from a specific class to do the work for us. We should expect <em>any</em>
object to do what our contract says. As long as the object does what
we need, we should not be interested in his class of origin, his sex, or his religion.</p>

<p>For example, I need to show a photo on the screen.
I want that photo to be read from a file in PNG format. I’m
contracting an object from class <code class="highlighter-rouge">DataFile</code> and asking him to give me
the binary content of that image.</p>

<p>But wait, do I care where exactly the content will come from—the file on disk, or
an HTTP request, or maybe a document in Dropbox? Actually, I don’t. All I care about
is that some object gives me a byte array with PNG content. So my contract
would look like this:</p>

<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">interface</span> <span class="nc">Binary</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="kt">byte</span><span class="o">[]</span> <span class="nf">read</span><span class="o">();</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, any object from any class (not just <code class="highlighter-rouge">DataFile</code>) can work for me.
All he has to do, in order to be eligible, is to obey
the contract—by implementing the interface <code class="highlighter-rouge">Binary</code>.</p>

<p>The rule here is simple: every public method in a good object should
implement his counterpart from an interface. If your object has
public methods that are not inherited from any interface, he is badly designed.</p>

<p>There are two practical reasons for this. First, an object working
without a contract is impossible to mock in a unit test. Second,
a contract-less object is impossible to extend via
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern">decoration</a>.</p>

<h2 id="3-he-is-unique">3. He Is Unique</h2>

<p>A good object should always
<a href="/2014/12/15/how-much-your-objects-encapsulate.html">encapsulate</a> something in order
to be unique. If there is nothing to encapsulate, an object may
have identical clones, which I believe is bad. Here is an example
of a bad object, which may have clones:</p>

<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">HTTPStatus</span> <span class="kd">implements</span> <span class="nc">Status</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="kd">private</span> <span class="no">URL</span> <span class="n">page</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="no">URL</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"http://localhost"</span><span class="o">);</span>
  <span class="nd">@Override</span>
  <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">read</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="kd">throws</span> <span class="nc">IOException</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nc">HttpURLConnection</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">class</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">cast</span><span class="o">(</span>
      <span class="k">this</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">page</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">openConnection</span><span class="o">()</span>
    <span class="o">).</span><span class="na">getResponseCode</span><span class="o">();</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I can create a few instances of class <code class="highlighter-rouge">HTTPStatus</code>, and all of them will be
equal to each other:</p>

<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">first</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">HTTPStatus</span><span class="o">();</span>
<span class="n">second</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">HTTPStatus</span><span class="o">();</span>
<span class="k">assert</span> <span class="n">first</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">equals</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">second</span><span class="o">);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Obviously utility classes, which have only static methods,
can’t instantiate good objects. More generally, utility classes
don’t have any of the merits mentioned in this article and can’t
even be called “classes.” They are simply terrible abusers of an object paradigm
and exist in modern object-oriented languages only because their
inventors enabled static methods.</p>

<h2 id="4-he-is-immutable">4. He Is Immutable</h2>

<p>A good object should never change his encapsulated 
<a href="/2014/12/09/immutable-object-state-and-behavior.html">state</a>.
Remember, an object is a representative of a real-life entity, and this
entity should stay the same through the entire life of the object. In other
words, an object should never betray those whom he represents. He should
never change owners. :)</p>

<p>Be aware that immutability doesn’t mean that all methods always return the same values.
Instead, a good immutable object is very dynamic.
However, he never changes his internal state. For example:</p>

<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nd">@Immutable</span>
<span class="kd">final</span> <span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">HTTPStatus</span> <span class="kd">implements</span> <span class="nc">Status</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="kd">private</span> <span class="no">URL</span> <span class="n">page</span><span class="o">;</span>
  <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="nf">HTTPStatus</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="no">URL</span> <span class="n">url</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="k">this</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">page</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">url</span><span class="o">;</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
  <span class="nd">@Override</span>
  <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">read</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="kd">throws</span> <span class="nc">IOException</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nc">HttpURLConnection</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">class</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">cast</span><span class="o">(</span>
      <span class="k">this</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">page</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">openConnection</span><span class="o">()</span>
    <span class="o">).</span><span class="na">getResponseCode</span><span class="o">();</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Even though the method <code class="highlighter-rouge">read()</code> may return different values, the
object is immutable. He points to a certain web page and will
never point anywhere else. He will never change his encapsulated state, and he will
never betray the URL he represents.</p>

<p>Why is immutability a virtue? This article explains in detail:
<a href="/2014/06/09/objects-should-be-immutable.html">Objects Should Be Immutable</a>.
In a nutshell, immutable objects are better because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Immutable objects are simpler to construct, test, and use.</li>
  <li>Truly immutable objects are always <a href="/2017/01/17/synchronized-decorators.html">thread-safe</a>.</li>
  <li>They help avoid <a href="/2015/12/08/temporal-coupling-between-method-calls.html">temporal coupling</a>.</li>
  <li>Their usage is side-effect free (no defensive copies).</li>
  <li>They always have failure atomicity.</li>
  <li>They are much easier to cache.</li>
  <li>They prevent <a href="/2014/05/13/why-null-is-bad.html">NULL references</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, a good object doesn’t have
<a href="/2014/09/16/getters-and-setters-are-evil.html">setters</a>, which
may change his state and force him to betray the URL. In other words,
introducing a <code class="highlighter-rouge">setURL()</code> method would be a terrible mistake in class <code class="highlighter-rouge">HTTPStatus</code>.</p>

<p>Besides all that, immutable objects will force you to make
more cohesive, solid, and understandable designs, as this article
explains: <a href="/2014/11/07/how-immutability-helps.html">How Immutability Helps</a>.</p>

<h2 id="5-his-class-doesnt-have-anything-static">5. His Class Doesn’t Have Anything Static</h2>

<p>A static method implements a behavior of a class, not an object. Let’s say
we have class <code class="highlighter-rouge">File</code>, and his children have method <code class="highlighter-rouge">size()</code>:</p>

<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">final</span> <span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">File</span> <span class="kd">implements</span> <span class="nc">Measurable</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="nd">@Override</span>
  <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">size</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// calculate the size of the file and return</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So far, so good; the method <code class="highlighter-rouge">size()</code> is there because of the contract <code class="highlighter-rouge">Measurable</code>,
and every object of class <code class="highlighter-rouge">File</code> will be able to measure his size. A terrible
mistake would be to design this class with a static method instead
(this design is also known as
<a href="/2014/05/05/oop-alternative-to-utility-classes.html">a utility class</a>
and is very popular in Java, Ruby, and almost every OOP language):</p>

<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// TERRIBLE DESIGN, DON'T USE!</span>
<span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">File</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">static</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">size</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">String</span> <span class="n">file</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// calculate the size of the file and return</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This design runs completely against the object-oriented paradigm. Why?
Because static methods turn object-oriented programming into “class-oriented” programming.
This method, <code class="highlighter-rouge">size()</code>, exposes the behavior of the class, not of his objects. What’s
wrong with this, you may ask? Why can’t we have both objects and classes
as first-class citizens in our code? Why can’t both of them have methods and properties?</p>

<p>The problem is that with class-oriented programming,
decomposition doesn’t work anymore. We can’t break down a complex problem
into parts, because only a single instance of a class exists in the entire
program. The power of <a href="/2016/08/15/what-is-wrong-object-oriented-programming.html">OOP</a>
is that it allows us to use objects as an instrument
for scope decomposition. When I instantiate an object inside a method, he
is dedicated to my specific task. He is perfectly isolated from
all other objects around the method. This object is a <em>local variable</em>
in the scope of the method. A class, with his static methods, is always
a <em>global variable</em> no matter where I use him. Because of that, I can’t
isolate my interaction with this
<a href="/2017/05/16/monikers.html">variable</a> from others.</p>

<p>Besides being conceptually against object-oriented principles, public static
methods have a few practical drawbacks:</p>

<p>First, it’s <strong>impossible to mock</strong> them
(Well, you can use <a href="https://code.google.com/p/powermock/">PowerMock</a>,
but this will then be the most terrible decision
you could make in a Java project… I made it once, a few years ago).</p>

<p>Second, they are <strong>not thread-safe</strong> by definition, because they always
work with static variables, which are accessible from all threads. You can
make them thread-safe, but this will always require explicit
synchronization.</p>

<p>Every time you see a public static method, start rewriting immediately. I don’t
even want to mention how terrible static (or global) variables are. I think
it is just obvious.</p>

<h2 id="6-his-name-is-not-a-job-title">6. His Name Is Not a Job Title</h2>



<p>The name of an object should tell us what this object <strong>is</strong>, not what
it <strong>does</strong>, just like we name objects in real life: book instead of
page aggregator, cup instead of water holder, T-shirt instead of body dresser.
There are exceptions, of course, like printer or computer, but
they were invented just recently and by those who didn’t read this article. :)</p>

<p>For example, these names tell us who their owners are:
an apple, a file, a series of HTTP requests, a socket, an XML document, a list of users, a regular
expression, an integer, a PostgreSQL table, or Jeffrey Lebowski. A properly named object is always
possible to draw as a small picture. Even a regular expression can be drawn.</p>

<p>In the opposite, here is an example of names that tell us what their owners do:
a file reader, a text parser, a URL validator, an XML printer,
a service locator, a <a href="/2016/06/27/singletons-must-die.html">singleton</a>,
a script runner, or a Java programmer. Can you draw
any of them? No, you can’t. These names are not suitable for good objects.
They are terrible names that lead to terrible design.</p>

<p>In general, avoid names that end with “-er”—most of them are bad.</p>

<p>“What is the alternative of a <code class="highlighter-rouge">FileReader</code>?” I hear you asking. What would
be a better name? Let’s see. We already have <code class="highlighter-rouge">File</code>, which is a representative
of a real-world file on disk. This representative is not powerful enough for us,
because he doesn’t know how to read the content of the file. We want to create
a more powerful one that will have that ability. What would we call him?
Remember, the name should say what he is, not what he does. What is he? He
is a file that has data; not just a file, like <code class="highlighter-rouge">File</code>, but a more sophisticated
one, with data. So how about <code class="highlighter-rouge">FileWithData</code> or simply <code class="highlighter-rouge">DataFile</code>?</p>

<p>The same logic should be applicable to all other names.
Always think about <strong>what it is</strong> rather than what it does. Give your

<h2 id="7-his-class-is-either-final-or-abstract">7. His Class Is Either Final or Abstract</h2>



<p>A good object comes from either a final or abstract class. A <code class="highlighter-rouge">final</code> class is one that
can’t be extended via <a href="/2016/09/13/inheritance-is-procedural.html">inheritance</a>.
An <code class="highlighter-rouge">abstract</code> class is one that
can’t have instances. Simply put, a class should either say, “You can never break
me; I’m a black box for you” or “I’m broken already; fix me first and then use.”</p>

<p>There is nothing in between. A final class is a black box that you can’t modify
by any means. He works as he works, and you either use him or throw him away. You can’t
create another class that will inherit his properties. This is not allowed
because of that <code class="highlighter-rouge">final</code> modifier. The only way to extend such a final class
is through decoration of his children. Let’s say I have the class <code class="highlighter-rouge">HTTPStatus</code> (see
above), and I don’t like him. Well, I like him, but he’s not powerful enough
for me. I want him to
<a href="/2015/12/01/rethrow-exceptions.html">throw</a>
an exception if HTTP status is over 400. I want
his method, <code class="highlighter-rouge">read()</code>, to do more that it does now. A traditional way would be
to extend the class and overwrite his method:</p>

<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">OnlyValidStatus</span> <span class="kd">extends</span> <span class="nc">HTTPStatus</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="nf">OnlyValidStatus</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="no">URL</span> <span class="n">url</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="kd">super</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">url</span><span class="o">);</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
  <span class="nd">@Override</span>
  <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">read</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="kd">throws</span> <span class="nc">IOException</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">code</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kd">super</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">read</span><span class="o">();</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">code</span> <span class="o">&gt;=</span> <span class="mi">400</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
      <span class="k">throw</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nf">RuntimeException</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"Unsuccessful HTTP code"</span><span class="o">);</span>
    <span class="o">}</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">code</span><span class="o">;</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Why is this wrong? It is very wrong because we risk breaking
the logic of the entire parent class by overriding one of his methods. Remember,
once we override the method <code class="highlighter-rouge">read()</code> in the child class, all methods from the
parent class start to use his new version. We’re literally injecting
a new “piece of implementation” right into the class. Philosophically
speaking, this is an offense.</p>

<p>On the other hand, to extend a final class, you have to treat him like a black box
and decorate him with your own implementation (a.k.a.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern">Decorator Pattern</a>):</p>

<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">final</span> <span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">OnlyValidStatus</span> <span class="kd">implements</span> <span class="nc">Status</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="kd">private</span> <span class="kd">final</span> <span class="nc">Status</span> <span class="n">origin</span><span class="o">;</span>
  <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="nf">OnlyValidStatus</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">Status</span> <span class="n">status</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="k">this</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">origin</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">status</span><span class="o">;</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
  <span class="nd">@Override</span>
  <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">read</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="kd">throws</span> <span class="nc">IOException</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">code</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">origin</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">read</span><span class="o">();</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">code</span> <span class="o">&gt;=</span> <span class="mi">400</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
      <span class="k">throw</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nf">RuntimeException</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"Unsuccessful HTTP code"</span><span class="o">);</span>
    <span class="o">}</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">code</span><span class="o">;</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Make sure that this class is implementing the same
<a href="/2016/04/26/why-inputstream-design-is-wrong.html">interface</a>
as the original one: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Status</code>. The instance of <code class="highlighter-rouge">HTTPStatus</code> will
be passed into him through the constructor and encapsulated. Then every
call will be intercepted and implemented in a different way, if necessary.
In this design, we treat the original object as a black box and never
touch his internal logic.</p>

<p>If you don’t use that <code class="highlighter-rouge">final</code> keyword, anyone (including yourself) will
be able to extend the class and… offend him :( So a class without <code class="highlighter-rouge">final</code>
is a bad design.</p>

<p>An abstract class is the exact opposite case—he tells us that
he is incomplete and we can’t use him “as is.” We have to inject
our custom implementation logic into him, but only into the places he allows
us to touch. These places are explicitly marked as <code class="highlighter-rouge">abstract</code> methods.
For example, our <code class="highlighter-rouge">HTTPStatus</code> may look like this:</p>

<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">abstract</span> <span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">ValidatedHTTPStatus</span> <span class="kd">implements</span> <span class="nc">Status</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="nd">@Override</span>
  <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">final</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">read</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="kd">throws</span> <span class="nc">IOException</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">code</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">origin</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">read</span><span class="o">();</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">(!</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">isValid</span><span class="o">())</span> <span class="o">{</span>
      <span class="k">throw</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nf">RuntimeException</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"Unsuccessful HTTP code"</span><span class="o">);</span>
    <span class="o">}</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">code</span><span class="o">;</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
  <span class="kd">protected</span> <span class="kd">abstract</span> <span class="kt">boolean</span> <span class="nf">isValid</span><span class="o">();</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you see, the class doesn’t know how exactly to validate the HTTP
code, and he expects us to inject that logic through inheritance and through
overriding the method <code class="highlighter-rouge">isValid()</code>. We’re not going to offend him with
this inheritance, since he defended all other methods with <code class="highlighter-rouge">final</code> (pay
attention to the modifiers of his methods). Thus, the class is ready
for our offense and is perfectly guarded against it.</p>

<p>To summarize, your class should either be <code class="highlighter-rouge">final</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">abstract</code>—nothing in between.</p>

<p>Update (April 2017): If you also agree that
<a href="/2016/09/13/inheritance-is-procedural.html">implementation inheritance</a> is evil,
all your classes must be <code class="highlighter-rouge">final</code>.</p>
