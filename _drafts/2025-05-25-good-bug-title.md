A few weeks ago, [@horw] released a new GitHub plugin that fixes GitHub issue titles: [issue-title-ai].
Once an issue is created, the plugin asks ChatGPT---or DeepSeek, or Claude---to improve its title.
We've already integrated the plugin into [objectionary/eo] and a few other repositories.
Works like a charm.
What's wrong with the titles the way they are, you may ask?
Why do we need to ask ChatGPT to make them "better"?
It's simple and important.
A properly formulated problem---this essentially is a title---leads to faster and more accurate bug resolution.

Let's say, you try to download a PNG file, but get a text file instead.
You want to report this problem to the team.
How would you title such a bug report?
I'll give you a few options:

* "Why I get text file instead of PNG?"
* "I need text file, not PNG"
* "Fix CSV-file downloading feature"
* "PNG file downloading is broken"

Now, let's say you want to be able to download PDF file.
How would you title this feature request?
How about these options:

* "..."
