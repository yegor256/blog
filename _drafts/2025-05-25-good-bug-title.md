A few weeks ago, [@horw] released a new GitHub plugin that fixes GitHub issue titles: [issue-title-ai].
Once an issue is created, the plugin asks ChatGPT---or DeepSeek, or Claude---to improve its title.
We've already integrated the plugin into [objectionary/eo] and a few other repositories.
Works like a charm.
What's wrong with the titles the way they are, you may ask?
Why do we need to ask ChatGPT to make them "better"?
It's simple and important.
A properly formulated problem---this essentially is a title---leads to faster and more accurate bug resolution.
