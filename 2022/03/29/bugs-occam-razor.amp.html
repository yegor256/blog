      <h1>Bugs Occam's Razor</h1>
      <p>For each accepted explanation of a phenomenon, there may be an extremely 
large, perhaps even incomprehensible, number of possible and 
more complex alternatives. The principle of parsimony, also known
as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam's_razor">Occam’s razor</a>, 
suggests we prefer the simplest one. For example, 
“I can’t open the door and can’t attend the meeting” is a description
of a problem, which could be reduced to “I can’t open the door”
without losing any information, which might be important for those
who are waiting for me in the meeting room. I suggest applying the same
principle to bug reports.</p>

<p>Let’s say I design a simple imperative programming language and you submit
this bug report to me:</p>

<pre>Here is my code:

a := 7
a := a + 5 - 3
a := a / 3
print a

It doesn't work as expected. It prints 4, 
but it should print 3.</pre>

<p>Now I have to investigate and find out which operator is broken: 
maybe the addition doesn’t work, or maybe
the assignment, or the division. I don’t know, and I have to
<a href="/2016/02/09/are-you-still-debugging.html">debug/test</a> 
in order to find out… Me. Not you. Why not you?</p>

<p>The more I work with bug reports the more I believe that 
this must be your job as a bug reporter,
to play with the code and do the best you can to make your snippet as
short as it can to be to represent the defect.</p>

<p>Of course, you don’t need to do glass-box testing of my code finding the cause
of the bug, but on the API surface you must do your job and conclude
that the subtraction operator is broken:</p>

<pre>Here is my code:

a := 7
a := a - 3
print a

It doesn't work as expected. It prints 7, 
but it should print 4.</pre>

<p>Here, you’ve <em>reduced</em> the scope of the defect to a much smaller one. 
You did your “home work” and found out that only one 
particular operator in my programming language is broken: the
subtraction. You saved my time and increased the chance of your
bug report being fixed sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>In general, I believe that this bug optimization work 
must be done by reporters, not product owners.
I would even say that this might be a valid bug rejection reason: 
the report is not the simplest possible one.</p>
