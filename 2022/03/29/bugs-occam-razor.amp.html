The principle of parsimony, also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam's_razor">Occam’s razor</a>, suggests we prefer the simplest one. For example, “I can’t open the door and can’t attend the meeting” is a description of a problem, which could be reduced to “I can’t open the door” without losing any information, which might be important for those who are waiting for me in the meeting room. I suggest applying the same principle to bug reports.</p><amp-img src="/images/2022/03/game-of-thrones.jpg"alt="Game of Thrones (2011–2019) by David Benioff"height="615"width="1435"layout="responsive"></amp-img><p>Let’s say I design a simple imperative programming language and you submit this bug report to me:<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Here is my code:

a := 7
a := a + 5 - 3
a := a / 3
print a

It doesn't work as expected. It prints 4,
but it should print 3.
</code></pre></div></div><p>Now I have to investigate and find out which operator is broken: maybe the addition doesn’t work, or maybe the assignment, or the division. I don’t know, and I have to <a href="/2016/02/09/are-you-still-debugging.html">debug/test</a> in order to find out… Me. Not you. Why not you?<p>The more I work with bug reports, the more I believe that this must be your job as a bug reporter, to play with the code and do the best you can to make your snippet as short as it can be to represent the defect.<p>Of course, you don’t need to do glass-box testing of my code finding the cause of the bug, but on the API surface you must do your job and conclude that the subtraction operator is broken:<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Here is my code:

a := 7
a := a - 3
print a

It doesn't work as expected. It prints 7,
but it should print 4.
</code></pre></div></div><p>Here, you’ve <em>reduced</em> the scope of the defect to a much smaller one. You did your “home work” and found out that only one particular operator in my programming language is broken: the subtraction. You saved my time and increased the chance of your bug report being fixed sooner rather than later.<p>In general, I believe that this bug optimization work must be done by reporters, not product owners. I would even say that this might be a valid bug rejection reason: the report is not the simplest possible one.<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en"dir="ltr">If a bug report is messy or overly complex, who should clean it up before we start fixing it?</p>— Yegor Bugayenko (@yegor256) <a href="https://twitter.com/yegor256/status/1528370540628566018?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 22, 2022</a></blockquote></article>
