      <h1>Checked vs. Unchecked Exceptions: The Debate Is Not Over</h1>
      <p>Do we need checked exceptions at all? The
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6115896/java-checked-vs-unchecked-exception-explanation">debate</a>
is over, isn't it?
Not for me. While most object-oriented languages don't have them, and most programmers
think checked exceptions are a Java mistake, I believe in the
opposite—unchecked exceptions are the <strong>mistake</strong>. Moreover, I believe
multiple exception types are a bad idea too.</p>



<amp-img src="/images/2015/07/true-romance.jpg" alt="True Romance (1993) by Tony Scott" height="496" width="1200" layout="responsive"></amp-img>

<p>Let me first explain how I understand exceptions in object-oriented programming.
Then I'll compare my understanding with a "traditional" approach, and
we'll discuss the differences. So, my understanding first.</p>

<p>Say there is a method that saves some binary data to a file:</p>

<pre>public void save(File file, byte[] data)
  throws Exception {
  // save data to the file
}</pre>

<p>When everything goes right, the method just saves the data and returns control.
When something is wrong, it
<a href="/2015/12/01/rethrow-exceptions.html">throws</a>
<code>Exception</code> and we have to do something
about it:</p>

<pre>try {
  save(file, data);
} catch (Exception ex) {
  System.out.println("Sorry, we can't save right now.");
}</pre>

<p>When a method says it <code>throws</code> an exception, I understand that the
method is not <strong>safe</strong>. It may fail sometimes, and it's my responsibility to
either 1) handle this failure or 2) declare myself as <strong>unsafe</strong> too.</p>

<p>I know each method is designed with a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle">single responsibility principle</a>
in mind. This is a guarantee to me that if method <code>save()</code> fails, it means
the entire saving operation can't be completed. If I need to know what
the cause of this failure was, I will <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_chaining">un-chain</a>
the exception—traverse the stack of chained exceptions and stack traces
encapsulated in <code>ex</code>.</p>

<p>I never use exceptions for flow control, which means I <strong>never recover</strong>
situations where exceptions are thrown. When an exception occurs, I let it float up to the
highest level of the application. Sometimes I
<a href="/2015/12/01/rethrow-exceptions.html">rethrow</a>
it in order to add more semantic information to the chain. That's why it doesn't matter
to me what the cause of the exception thrown by <code>save()</code> was. I just know
the method failed. That's enough for me. Always.</p>

<p>For the same reason, I don't need to differentiate between different exception
types. I just don't need that type of hierarchy. <code>Exception</code> is enough for me.
Again, that's because I don't use exceptions for flow control.</p>

<p>That's how I understand exceptions.</p>

<p>According to this paradigm, I would say we must:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>always use checked exceptions.</p></li>
<li><p>never throw/use unchecked exceptions.</p></li>
<li><p>use only <code>Exception</code>, without any sub-types.</p></li>
<li><p>always declare one exception type in the <code>throws</code> block.</p></li>
<li><p>never catch without rethrowing; read <a href="/2015/07/09/catch-if-cant-otherwise.html">more about that here</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This paradigm diverges from many other articles I've found on this subject.
Let's compare and discuss.</p>

<h2 id="runtime-vs-api-exceptions">Runtime vs. API Exceptions</h2>

<p><a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/runtime.html">Oracle says</a>
some exceptions should be part of API (checked ones) while some are
runtime exceptions and should not be part of it (unchecked). They will be documented
in JavaDoc but not in the method signature.</p>

<p>I don't understand the logic here, and I'm sure Java designers don't
understand it either. How and why are some exceptions important while
others are not? Why do some of them deserve a proper API position
in the <code>throws</code> block of the method signature while others don't? What is the criteria?</p>

<p>I have an answer here, though. By introducing checked and unchecked exceptions, Java
developers tried to solve the problem of methods that are too complex and messy. When
a method is too big and does too many things at the same time (violates
the single responsibility principle), it's definitely better to let us
keep some exceptions "hidden" (a.k.a. unchecked).
But it's not a real solution. It is only
a temporary patch that does all of us more harm than good—methods keep
growing in size and complexity.</p>

<p>Unchecked exceptions are a mistake in Java design, not
<a href="/2015/10/20/interrupted-exception.html">checked</a> ones.</p>

<p>Hiding the fact that a method may fail at some point is a mistake. That's
exactly what unchecked exceptions do.</p>

<p>Instead, we should make this fact visible. When a method does too many
things, there will be too many points of failure, and the author of the
method will realize that something is wrong—a method should
not throw exceptions in so many situations. This will lead to refactoring. The existence of
unchecked exceptions leads to a mess. By the way, checked exceptions don't exist
at all in Ruby, C#, Python, PHP, etc. This means that creators of these
languages understand
<a href="/2016/08/15/what-is-wrong-object-oriented-programming.html">OOP</a> even less than Java authors.</p>

<h2 id="checked-exceptions-are-too-noisy">Checked Exceptions Are Too Noisy</h2>

<p>Another common argument against checked exceptions is that they make our
code more verbose. We have to put <code>try/catch</code> everywhere instead of
staying focused on the main logic. Bozhidar Bozhanov even
<a href="http://techblog.bozho.net/checked-and-unchecked-exceptions-in-java/">suggests</a>
a technical solution for this verbosity problem.</p>

<p>Again, I don't understand this logic. If I want to do something when method
<code>save()</code> fails, I catch the exception and handle the situation somehow.
If I don't want to do that, I just say my method also <code>throws</code> and pay no
attention to exception handling. What is the problem? Where is the verbosity
coming from?</p>

<p>I have an answer here, too. It's coming from the existence of unchecked
exceptions. We simply can't always ignore failure, because the interfaces
we're using don't allow us to do this. That's all. For example, class
<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Runnable.html"><code>Runnable</code></a>,
which is widely used for multi-thread programming, has
method <code>run()</code> that is not supposed to throw anything. That's why we always have
to catch everything inside the method and rethrow checked
exceptions as unchecked.</p>

<p>If all methods in all Java
<a href="/2016/04/26/why-inputstream-design-is-wrong.html">interfaces</a> would be declared either as
"safe" (<code>throws</code> nothing) or "unsafe" (<code>throws Exception</code>), everything would
become logical and clear. If you want to stay "safe," take responsibility
for failure handling. Otherwise, be "unsafe" and let your users worry about
safety.</p>

<p>No noise, very clean code, and obvious logic.</p>

<h2 id="inappropriately-exposed-implementation-details">Inappropriately Exposed Implementation Details</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-jtp05254/">Some say</a>
the ability to put a checked exception into <code>throws</code> in the method
signature instead of catching it here and rethrowing a new type
encourages us to have too many irrelevant exception types in method
signatures. For example, our method <code>save()</code> may declare that it
may throw <code>OutOfMemoryException</code>, even though it seems to have
nothing to do with memory allocation. But it does allocate some memory, right?
So such a memory overflow may happen during a file saving operation.</p>

<p>Yet again, I don't get the logic of this argument.
If all exceptions are checked, and we don't have multiple exception types,
we just throw <code>Exception</code> everywhere, and that's it. Why do we need to care
about the exception type in the first place? If we don't use exceptions to control
flow, we won't do this.</p>

<p>If we really want to make our application memory overflow-resistant, we will
introduce some memory manager, which will have something like the <code>bigEnough()</code>
method, which will tell us whether our heap is big enough for the next
operation. Using exceptions in such situations is a totally inappropriate approach
to exception management in OOP.</p>

<h2 id="recoverable-exceptions">Recoverable Exceptions</h2>

<p>Joshua Bloch, in <a href="http://amzn.to/2crH5tW">Effective Java</a>,
says to "use checked exceptions for recoverable conditions and runtime exceptions
for programming errors." He means something like this:</p>

<pre>try {
  save(file, data);
} catch (Exception ex) {
  // We can't save the file, but it's OK
  // Let's move on and do something else
}</pre>

<p>How is that any different from a famous anti-pattern called
<a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DontUseExceptionsForFlowControl">Don't Use Exceptions for Flow Control</a>?
Joshua, with all due respect, you're wrong. There are no such things
as recoverable conditions in OOP. An exception indicates that the execution of a
chain of calls from method to method is broken, and it's time to go up
through the chain and stop somewhere. But we never go back again
after the exception:</p>

<pre>App#run()
  Data#update()
    Data#write()
      File#save() &lt;-- Boom, there's a failure here, so we go up</pre>

<p>We can start this chain again, but we don't go back after <code>throw</code>. In other
words, we don't <strong>do</strong> anything in the <code>catch</code> block. We only report the problem
and wrap up execution. We never "recover!"</p>

<hr>

<p>All arguments against checked exceptions demonstrate nothing but
a serious misunderstanding of object-oriented programming by their authors.
The mistake in Java and in many other languages is the existence of unchecked
exceptions, not checked ones.</p>
