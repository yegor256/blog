He also offered me many types of shampoo and a cup of tea. All this reminded me of the work we do as programmers, and I decided to write a short post about it. I’ve already <a href="/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html">mentioned before</a> that trying to make a customer happy is a false objective. This hairdresser was a perfect illustrative example of this very mistake. By the way, in the end, I wasn’t happy, and he got no tip. How could this happen if he was so friendly and nice?</p><amp-img src="/images/2015/02/the-man-who-wasnt-there.jpg"alt="The Man Who Wasn't There (2001) by Coen Brothers"height="688"width="1280"layout="responsive"></amp-img><p>I’m not a hairdresser, and I have very little understanding of how to deal with hair. I came to him because I assumed he knew more about this business than I did. I chose him through the assistance of Yelp. I wanted <em>him</em> to tell me how long the hair on the sides should be and how much should be removed on the top. I expected <em>him</em> to give me his professional judgment and stand by it.<p>Instead of asking me how much I wanted removed on the sides, he should have told me there should be less on the sides. This is what a true professional would do. A true professional would give me <em>his</em> vision of the haircut that best suits me and would try to convince me that it was the best choice.<p>A true professional would not ask me but would <em>tell</em> me instead, because he would understand that my goal was not to boss him around and make him do my hair the way I wanted it. My goal was to get the best out of his professional skill.<p>Unfortunately, the guy was either weak or immature. He didn’t argue with me and didn’t try to convince me. He tried to <em>please</em> me. In the end, he lost.<p>Exactly the same thing happens when we ask our customers about the technologies they want us to use. I hear this question very often: <em>What language do you want us to use</em> (meaning Java or Ruby or something else)? Or <em>what database should we use?</em> Or <em>how do you want us to design this?</em><p>Don’t do that. Don’t lose like that hairdresser. Don’t ask your clients what they want. Instead, <em>learn</em> their business requirements and then <em>suggest</em> the solution you think is the best for them. Then, insist and argue if they don’t agree. <a href="/2016/07/21/convince-me.html">Convince</a> them. Even if they fire you in the end for your stubbornness, it’s better than being that hairdresser who is doomed to please every single client without getting anywhere further.<p>Remember, the <a href="/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html">client</a> is not the king; his hairs are.<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en"dir="ltr">The client is...</p>— Yegor Bugayenko (@yegor256) <a href="https://twitter.com/yegor256/status/1277224378934099970?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 28, 2020</a></blockquote></article>
