Of course, I didn’t like the movie as a <a href="/2014/04/06/movies-for-thanasis.html">piece of art</a>. It is total garbage, but this is not my point. There is something bigger to discuss, aside from the bad acting, primitive story-line, politically correct but absolutely unrealistic casting, and tons of logical inconsistencies. It’s Hollywood; what should I expect, right? Not just that. I think the problem is bigger.</p><amp-img src="/images/2015/10/cossacks-of-the-kuban.jpg"alt="Кубанские казаки (1950) by Иван Пырьев"height="897"width="1200"layout="responsive"></amp-img><p>Have any of you seen this movie: <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041562/">Cossacks of the Kuban</a>? It was shot in 1949, when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a> was in power, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union">Soviet Union</a> was literally broke, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II">WWII</a> brought people to the point of <em>starvation</em>. However, the film showed something completely opposite—wealthy villages, rich peasants, and tables full of food.<p>It was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda">propaganda</a> in 1949.<p>But isn’t it quite similar to what I’ve just seen a few days ago, produced and directed in 2015 by <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000631/">Ridley Scott</a>?<p>In 1949, the goal of Soviet propaganda was to convince people that their personal situations with a lack of food and lack of future were just their local, personal <em>exceptions</em> to a more general rule. And that rule was that the country was full of food. The country was governed by the principles of socialism, and they were working perfectly.<p>In 2015, the goal of Hollywood propaganda is to convince us that the organizational and motivational problems in our <a href="/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html">offices</a> are just local exceptions to the general rule. The rule is simple: project management is not important if we’re all good friends.<p>Ridley Scott is telling us that in a perfect organization, such as <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/">NASA</a>, everybody <em>loves</em> everyone; that’s why they can get a man from Mars without even a map. Do the same in your company and you will be fine. You don’t need risk planning, you just need a hero. Actually, you’d be better off with a couple of heroes who love each other.<p>That doesn’t work for you? It must be a problem with implementation. Keep trying and smiling.<p>Make friends, don’t make plans.<p>It is a lie, very similar to the lie we heard in 1949.<p>The truth is that you are not going to get anywhere if you follow the spirit of this movie. In reality, teamwork must look completely different. There are <a href="/2017/01/03/how-much-you-love-conflicts.html">conflicts</a>, fights, politics, betrayals, back-stabbing, leakage of information, and just primitive incompetence. To manage all this, one can’t just be a <em>nice guy</em> with a big heart. I would even say that being a nice guy is a drawback for any management position in a modern organization. Well, in any organization at any time and in any place.<p>Project management is <a href="/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html">not</a> about compassion and sympathy. It is about accurate and routine comparison of risks, probabilities, impacts, and their mitigation plans. It is about <a href="/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html">setting rules</a> and making <em>decisions</em>. It is about making sure these decisions are being executed, precisely and without mistakes. It is about <a href="/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html">making sure</a> those who’ve made mistakes are <em>punished</em> while those who’ve done everything right are <em>rewarded</em>.<p>A team of six. In a multi-million-dollar spaceship. Flying to another planet to save one person. Against explicit instructions from upper management. They come back as national heroes. Are you serious?<p>Have you tried to deploy a new feature on a production server against the direct will of your boss? Try it. No spaceships, no Mars. Just a piece of code and a simple server. Then try to convince your boss that you’re a hero.<p>I’m sure you get the point.<p>So, why is Ridley Scott <em>lying</em> to us? Why is he giving us a false picture of reality? Intentionally <em>false</em>. He knows better than I do how real management works in real-life organizations. Hollywood is not much different than Silicon Valley in this aspect. So, why is he lying?<p>Why was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Goebbels">Joseph Goebbels</a>, a minister of propaganda in the Third Reich, lying to the German people?<p>Because that’s what we like to hear, <em>unfortunately</em>.<p>It is sad, but we don’t want to know the truth. We didn’t want to know about Nazi war crimes—so Joseph Goebbels built a <em>fake</em> reality for us. We don’t want to know about the true principles of management—so Ridley Scott built fake ones for us.<p>Think about it.</article>
