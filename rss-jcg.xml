        <title>Don&apos;t Use Java Assertions</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;There are basically two ways to validate a situation in Java and complain
when something unexpected happens. It’s either an exception
or an assertion. Technically, they are almost the same, but there are some
small differences. I believe that exceptions are the right way to go
in all situations and assertions should never be used. Here’s why.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Test Methods Must Share Nothing</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Constants… I wrote about them
&lt;a href=&quot;/2015/07/06/public-static-literals.html&quot;&gt;some time ago&lt;/a&gt;, mostly
saying that they are a bad thing, if being public. They reduce duplication,
but introduce coupling. A much better way to get rid of duplication is
by creating new classes or methods—a traditional OOP method. This seems to make
sense and in our projects I see less and less public constants. In
some projects we don’t have them at all. But one thing still bothers me:
unit tests. Most programmers seem to think that when static analysis says
that there are too many similar literals in the same file, the best way
to get rid of them is via a private static literal. This is just wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why InputStream Design Is Wrong</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s not just about &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;InputSteam&lt;/code&gt;, this class is a good
example of a bad design. I’m talking about three overloaded
methods &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;read()&lt;/code&gt;. I’ve mentioned this problem in Section 2.9
of &lt;a href=&quot;/elegant-objects.html&quot;&gt;Elegant Objects&lt;/a&gt;. In a few words,
I strongly believe that interfaces must be “functionality poor.”
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;InputStream&lt;/code&gt; should have been an interface in the first place
and it should have had a single method &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;read(byte[])&lt;/code&gt;. Then if
its authors wanted to give us extra functionality, they should have
created supplementary “smart” classes.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Object Behavior Must Not Be Configurable</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Using object properties as configuration parameters is a very common
mistake we keep making mostly because our objects
are mutable—we &lt;em&gt;configure&lt;/em&gt; them. We change their behavior by
injecting parameters or even entire settings/configuration objects
into them. Do I have to say that it’s abusive and disrespectful
from a &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/11/20/seven-virtues-of-good-object.html&quot;&gt;philosophical&lt;/a&gt;
point of view? I can, but let’s take a look at
it from a practical perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Java Annotations Are a Big Mistake</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_annotation&quot;&gt;Annotations&lt;/a&gt;
were introduced in Java 5, and we all got excited. Such a great
instrument to make code shorter! No more Hibernate/Spring XML configuration
files! Just annotations, right there in the code where we need them. No more
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marker_interface_pattern&quot;&gt;marker interfaces&lt;/a&gt;,
just a &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/annotation/Retention.html&quot;&gt;runtime-retained&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4296910/&quot;&gt;reflection-discoverable&lt;/a&gt; annotation!
I was excited too. Moreover, I’ve made a few open source libraries which
use annotations heavily. Take &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jcabi/jcabi-aspects&quot;&gt;jcabi-aspects&lt;/a&gt;,
for example. However, I’m not excited any more. Moreover, I believe that
annotations are a big mistake in Java design.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Printers Instead of Getters</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Getters and setters &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/09/16/getters-and-setters-are-evil.html&quot;&gt;are evil&lt;/a&gt;.
No need to argue about this, it’s settled. You disagree?
Let’s discuss that later. For now, let’s say, we want to get rid of getters.
The key question is how is it possible at all? We do need to get
the data out of an object, right? Nope. Wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Try. Finally. If. Not. Null.</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a very typical mistake in pre-Java7 “try/finally” scenario,
which I keep seeing in so many code reviews. I just have to write about it.
Java7 introduced a solution, but it doesn’t cover all situations.
Sometimes we need to deal with non-&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;AutoCloseable&lt;/code&gt; resources. Let’s
open and close them correctly, please.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Are You Still Debugging?</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging&quot;&gt;Debugging&lt;/a&gt;
is “a process of running a program/method interactively,
breaking execution flow after each statement and showing…” In a nutshell, it is
a very useful technique … for a bad programmer. Or an old programmer
who is still writing procedural code in C. Object-oriented programmers
never debug their code—they write unit tests. My point here
is that unit testing is a technique that completely replaces debugging.
If debugging is required, the &lt;em&gt;design is bad&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Design Patterns and Anti-Patterns, Love and Hate</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern&quot;&gt;Design Patterns&lt;/a&gt; are …
Come on, you know what they are. They are
something we &lt;strong&gt;love&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;hate&lt;/strong&gt;. We love them because they let us
write code without thinking. We hate them when we see the code
of someone who is used to writing code without thinking. Am I wrong?
Now, let me try to go through all of them and show you how much
I love or hate each one. Follow me, in alphabetic order.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Defensive Programming via Validating Decorators</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Do you check the input parameters of your methods for validity?
I don’t. I used to, but not anymore.
I just let my methods crash with a null pointer and other exceptions
when parameters are not valid.
This may sound illogical, but only in the beginning.
I’m suggesting you use &lt;em&gt;validating decorators&lt;/em&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Good Programmers Don&apos;t Work for Equity</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;“You’re a good programmer. I’m a great entrepreneur. This is a
breakthrough idea. Help me build it. I don’t have cash, but I will
give you equity. Deal?” I hear this at least once a month, and
I always say no. Not because I don’t like your idea. Indeed, it
is really interesting. And not because I’m too busy. I would
definitely find time for a good idea. It’s not that. I say no because
I don’t think you’re a good entrepreneur.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Temporal Coupling Between Method Calls</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Temporal coupling happens between sequential method calls
when they must stay in a particular order. This is inevitable
in imperative programming, but we can reduce the negative effect
of it just by turning those static procedures into functions. Take
a look at this example.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Throwing an Exception Without Proper Context Is a Bad Habit</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I keep repeating the same mistake again and again. So it’s time to
stop and make a rule to prevent this from happening anymore. The mistake
is not fatal, but it’s very annoying. When I look at production logs, I often see
something like &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&quot;File doesn&apos;t exist&quot;&lt;/code&gt;, and I ask myself:
What file? Where is it supposed to exist? What did the server try to do with it?
What was going on a second before it crashed?
There is no answer in the log, and it’s totally my fault.
I either 1) don’t re-throw or 2) re-throw without providing context.
Both are wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern&quot;&gt;decorator pattern&lt;/a&gt;
is one of the best ways to add features to an object
without changing its interface. I use
&lt;a href=&quot;/2015/02/26/composable-decorators.html&quot;&gt;composable decorators&lt;/a&gt;
quite often and always question myself as to how to design them right
when the list of features must be configurable.
I’m not sure I have the right answer, but here is
some food for thought.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>When Do You Stop Testing?</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a software to be tested. There is a team of testers. There is
some money in the budget. There is some time in the schedule. We start
right now. Testers are trying to break the product, finding bugs,
reporting bugs, communicating with programmers when necessary, doing
their best to find what’s wrong. Eventually they stop and say
“we’re done.” How do they know when to stop? When there is enough
testing? It’s obvious—when there are &lt;em&gt;no more bugs left&lt;/em&gt; and the
product can be shipped! If you think like this, I have bad news for you.
You’re &lt;em&gt;fundamentally wrong&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Need Robust Software? Make It Fragile</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;In any software project, the goal is to create something stable. We don’t want it
to break in front of a user. We also don’t want our website to show an
“internal application error” instead of a web page. We want our software
to work, not fail. That’s a perfectly valid and logical desire,
but in order to achieve that, we have to make our software as fragile
as possible. This may sound counter-intuitive, but that’s the way it is.
The more &lt;em&gt;fragile&lt;/em&gt; your app is in development, the more &lt;em&gt;robust&lt;/em&gt; it is
in production.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Checked vs. Unchecked Exceptions: The Debate Is Not Over</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Do we need checked exceptions at all? The
&lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6115896/java-checked-vs-unchecked-exception-explanation&quot;&gt;debate&lt;/a&gt;
is over, isn’t it?
Not for me. While most object-oriented languages don’t have them, and most programmers
think checked exceptions are a Java mistake, I believe in the
opposite—unchecked exceptions are the &lt;strong&gt;mistake&lt;/strong&gt;. Moreover, I believe
multiple exception types are a bad idea too.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Fools Don&apos;t Write Unit Tests</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;“We don’t have time to write unit tests” or “We don’t have the
budget for unit testing” are complaints I hear very often. Sometimes it
may sound like, “We don’t use
&lt;a href=&quot;/2017/03/24/tdd-that-works.html&quot;&gt;TDD&lt;/a&gt;, so that’s why there are no unit tests,” or even
“TDD is too expensive for us now.” I’m sure you’ve heard this or even
said it yourself. It doesn’t make any sense to me. I don’t get the
logic. In my understanding, unit testing is not
a product; it’s a &lt;em&gt;tool&lt;/em&gt;. You use tests to develop a product
faster and better. How can you say you don’t have time to use
the tool that makes your work faster? Let me show you how.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Few Valid Reasons to Reject a Bug Fix</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;A bug exists when something doesn’t work as expected. A &lt;em&gt;bug
fix&lt;/em&gt; is basically a patch (a pull request) to the existing code base that
is supposed to solve the problem and make sure that “something”
works as expected. Very often, such a patch fixes one thing
and breaks many others. I believe that sometimes it’s necessary to &lt;em&gt;reject&lt;/em&gt;
a bug fix and ask its author to re-do the patch in order to
protect the project from bigger problems. There are a few
valid reasons for such a rejection, according to my experience.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Good Programmers Write Bug-Free Code, Don&apos;t They?</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Good programmers create fewer
&lt;a href=&quot;/2015/06/11/wikipedia-bug-definition.html&quot;&gt;bugs&lt;/a&gt;
while bad programmers cause more. Sounds
logical, doesn’t it? However, there is a lot of criticism of this way of
thinking. Take this one, for example: Bugs are inevitable, and
instead of expecting fewer bugs from us, let us focus on the right design
and let testers find and report bugs; then we’ll fix them. Or this one:
Being afraid to make a mistake makes me write slower and experiment less,
which translates into lower-quality software. Read more about that
&lt;a href=&quot;http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/41248&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000067.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
But allow me to look at this from a different perspective and assert
that yes, indeed, good programmers create &lt;em&gt;fewer&lt;/em&gt; bugs.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Wikipedia&apos;s Definition of a Software Bug Is Wrong</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Here is what &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug&quot;&gt;Wikipedia says&lt;/a&gt;
at the time of this writing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A software bug is an error, flaw, failure, or fault
in a computer program or system that causes it
to produce an incorrect or unexpected result or
to behave in unintended ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that’s incomplete. The definition entirely excludes “non-behavioral”
defects related to, for example, &lt;em&gt;maintainability&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;reusability&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Few Thoughts on Unit Test Scaffolding</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;When I start to repeat myself in unit test methods by creating
the same objects and preparing the data to run the test,
I feel disappointed in my design. Long test methods with a lot of code
duplication just don’t look right. To simplify and shorten them,
there are basically two options, at least in Java: 1) private properties
initialized through &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@Before&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@BeforeClass&lt;/code&gt;, and 2)
&lt;a href=&quot;/2017/02/07/private-method-is-new-class.html&quot;&gt;private static methods&lt;/a&gt;.
They both look anti-OOP to me, and I think there is an
alternative. Let me explain.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Constructors Must Be Code-Free</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;How much work should be done within a constructor? It seems reasonable
to do some computations inside a constructor and then encapsulate
results. That way, when the results are required by object methods, we’ll have them
ready. Sounds like a good approach? No, it’s not. It’s a bad idea
for one reason: It prevents composition of objects and makes them
un-extensible.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Implement an Iterating Adapter</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Iterator.html&quot;&gt;Iterator&lt;/a&gt;
is one of the fundamental Java
&lt;a href=&quot;/2016/04/26/why-inputstream-design-is-wrong.html&quot;&gt;interfaces&lt;/a&gt;,
introduced in Java 1.2. It is supposed
to be very simple; however, in my experience, many Java developers don’t understand
how to implement a custom one, which should iterate a stream of data
coming from some other source. In other words, it becomes an &lt;em&gt;adapter&lt;/em&gt; of
another source of data, in the form of an iterator. I hope this example will help.&lt;/p&gt;

Also, I’m a big fan of object-oriented programming in its purest form; for example, see

I’m also a co-founder and the CEO of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerocracy.com&quot;&gt;Zerocracy&lt;/a&gt;, a software development

        <title>JAXB Is Doing It Wrong; Try Xembly</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Architecture_for_XML_Binding&quot;&gt;JAXB&lt;/a&gt;
is a 10-year-old Java technology that allows us to
convert a Java object into an XML document (marshalling) and
back (unmarshalling). This technology is based on
&lt;a href=&quot;/2014/09/16/getters-and-setters-are-evil.html&quot;&gt;setters and getters&lt;/a&gt;
and, in my opinion, violates key principles of object-oriented
programming by turning objects into &lt;strong&gt;passive data structures&lt;/strong&gt;. I would
recommend you use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xembly.org&quot;&gt;Xembly&lt;/a&gt;
instead for marshalling Java objects into XML documents.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Java Web App Architecture In Takes Framework</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I used to utilize Servlets, JSP, JAX-RS, Spring Framework, Play Framework,
JSF with Facelets, and a bit of Spark Framework. All of these solutions,
in my humble opinion, are very far from being object-oriented and elegant.
They all are full of static methods, un-testable data structures, and
dirty hacks. So about a month ago, I decided to create my own Java web
framework. I put a few basic principles into its foundation: 1) No
&lt;a href=&quot;/2014/05/13/why-null-is-bad.html&quot;&gt;NULLs&lt;/a&gt;,
2) no public &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/05/05/oop-alternative-to-utility-classes.html&quot;&gt;static&lt;/a&gt; methods, 3) no
&lt;a href=&quot;/2014/06/09/objects-should-be-immutable.html&quot;&gt;mutable&lt;/a&gt;
classes, and 4) no class casting, reflection,
and &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/04/02/class-casting-is-anti-pattern.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;instanceof&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
operators. These four basic principles should guarantee
clean code and transparent architecture. That’s how the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.takes.org&quot;&gt;Takes&lt;/a&gt; framework was born.
Let’s see what was created and how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Composable Decorators vs. Imperative Utility Methods</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern&quot;&gt;decorator pattern&lt;/a&gt;
is my favorite among all other patterns I’m aware of. It is a very simple
and yet very powerful mechanism to make your code
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohesion_%28computer_science%29&quot;&gt;highly cohesive&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_%28computer_programming%29&quot;&gt;loosely coupled&lt;/a&gt;.
However, I believe decorators are not used often enough. They should
be everywhere, but they are not. The biggest advantage we get from decorators
is that they make our code &lt;em&gt;composable&lt;/em&gt;. That’s why the title of this
post is composable decorators. Unfortunately, instead of decorators, we often use imperative
utility methods, which make our code procedural rather than object-oriented.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Haircut</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I received a haircut today, and the niceness of my hairdresser led him to fill the
appointment with courteous questions about how I wanted my hair cut, what size of clipper
he should use, how long the sides should be, and how much should be removed
from the front. He also offered me many types of shampoo and a cup of tea.
All this reminded me of the work we do as programmers, and I
decided to write a short post about it. I’ve already
&lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html&quot;&gt;mentioned before&lt;/a&gt;
that trying to make a customer happy is a false objective. This hairdresser
was a perfect illustrative example of this very mistake. By the way, in the end,
I wasn’t happy, and he got no tip. How could this happen if he was so
friendly and nice?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Utility Classes Have Nothing to Do With Functional Programming</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I was recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lukaseder/status/564866432790708224&quot;&gt;accused&lt;/a&gt; of being against
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming&quot;&gt;functional programming&lt;/a&gt;
because &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/05/05/oop-alternative-to-utility-classes.html&quot;&gt;I call utility classes an anti-pattern&lt;/a&gt;.
That’s absolutely wrong! Well, I do consider them a terrible anti-pattern,
but they have nothing to do with functional programming. I believe there are
two basic reasons why. First, functional programming is declarative, while
utility class methods are imperative. Second,
functional programming is based on lambda calculus, where
a function can be assigned to a variable. Utility class methods
are not functions in this sense. I’ll decode these statements in a minute.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Code For the User, Not for Yourself</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;First, no matter what the methodology is, we all write software for our
users (a.k.a. customers, project sponsors, end users, or
&lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html&quot;&gt;clients&lt;/a&gt;). Second,
no matter what the methodology is, we write incrementally, releasing
features and bug fixes one by one. Maybe I’m saying something absolutely obvious here,
but it’s important to remember that each new version should first of all satisfy
the needs of the user, not of us programmers. In other words, the way
we decompose a big task into smaller pieces should be user-targeted, and that’s
why you always work &lt;strong&gt;top down&lt;/strong&gt;. Let’s see what I mean through a practical example.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Don&apos;t Repeat Yourself in Maven POMs; Use Jcabi-Parent</title>
        
          <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://http.jcabi.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.jcabi.com/logo-square.svg&quot; style=&quot;width:64px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maven is a build automation tool mostly for Java projects. It’s a great
tool, but it has one important drawback that has motivated the creation
of similar tools, like Gradle and SBT. That weakness is its verbosity of configuration.
Maven gets all project build parameters from &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pom.xml&lt;/code&gt;, an XML
file that can get very long. I’ve seen POM files of 3,000-plus lines.
Taking into account 1) recent DSL buzz and 2) fear of XML, it’s
only logical that many people don’t like Maven because of its &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pom.xml&lt;/code&gt; verbosity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even if you’re an XML fan who enjoys its strictness and elegance
(like myself), you won’t like the necessity to repeat yourself in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pom.xml&lt;/code&gt;
for every project. If you’re working on multiple projects, code duplication
will be enormous. An average Java web app uses a few dozen standard Maven plugins
and almost the same number of pretty common dependencies, like
JUnit, Apache Commons, Log4J, Mockito, etc. All of them have their versions
and configurations, which have to be specified if you want to keep
the project stable and avoid Maven warnings. Thus, once a new version
of a plugin is released, you have to go through all &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pom.xml&lt;/code&gt; files in
the projects you’re working on and update it there. You obviously understand
what code duplication means. It’s a disaster. However, there is a solution.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>XSL Transformation in Java: An Easy Way</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/xslt20/&quot;&gt;XSL transformation&lt;/a&gt;
(XSLT) is a powerful mechanism for converting one
XML document into another. However, in Java, XML manipulations
are rather verbose and complex. Even for a simple XSL transformation,
you have to write a few dozen lines of code—and maybe even more
than that if proper exception handling and logging is needed.
&lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/24/java-xml-parsing-and-traversing.html&quot;&gt;jcabi-xml&lt;/a&gt; is
a small open source library that makes life much easier by enabling
XML parsing and XPath traversing with
&lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/24/java-xml-parsing-and-traversing.html&quot;&gt;a few simple methods&lt;/a&gt;. Let’s
see how this library helps in XSL transformations.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Making Your Boss Happy Is a False Objective</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;We all have bosses. We also have customers who pay us for running
their software projects. They are my bosses for the time of the contract. I’m also
acting as a boss for developers who are working for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerocracy.com&quot;&gt;Zerocracy&lt;/a&gt;.
It is obvious that a good employee/contractor is one who makes his
boss/customer happy. But only a bad employee works toward
this goal. Trying to make your boss happy is a false target that,
if pursued, ruins the project. A professional employee works
for the project, not for the boss.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;You have a task assigned to you, and you don’t like it. You are simply
not in the mood. You don’t know how to fix that damn bug. You have no idea
how that bloody module was designed, and you don’t know how it works. But
you have to fix the issue, which was reported by someone who has no clue how
this software works. You get frustrated and blame that
&lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/22/micromanagement.html&quot;&gt;stupid project manager&lt;/a&gt; and
programmers who were fired two years ago. You spend hours just to find out
how the code works. Then even more hours trying to fix it. In the end,
you miss the deadline and &lt;em&gt;everybody blames you&lt;/em&gt;. Been there, done that?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Compound Name Is a Code Smell</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Do you name variables like &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;textLength&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;table_name&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;current-user-email&lt;/code&gt;?
All three are compound names that consist of more than one word. Even though
they look more descriptive than &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;name&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;length&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;email&lt;/code&gt;, I would strongly
recommend avoiding them. I believe a variable name that is more complex than a noun
is a code smell. Why? Because we usually give a variable a compound name when its scope
is so big and complex that a simple noun would sound ambiguous.
And a big, complex scope is an obvious code smell.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Be Honest and Keep a Customer</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Most of our
&lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html&quot;&gt;clients&lt;/a&gt;
are rather surprised when we explain to them that
they will have full access to the source code from the first day
of the project. We let them see everything that is happening in
the project, including the Git repository,
&lt;a href=&quot;/2018/04/24/right-way-to-report-bugs.html&quot;&gt;bug reports&lt;/a&gt;, discussions
between programmers,
&lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/08/continuous-integration-is-dead.html&quot;&gt;continuous integration&lt;/a&gt; fails, etc.
They often tell me that other software development
&lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/27/outsourcing-doesnt-work.html&quot;&gt;outsourcing teams&lt;/a&gt;
keep this information in-house and deliver only final releases,
rarely together with the source code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand why other developers are trying to hide as much as possible.
Giving a project sponsor full access to the development environment
is &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/05/21/avoid-software-outsourcing-disaster.html&quot;&gt;not easy&lt;/a&gt;
at all. Here is a summary
of problems we’ve been having and our solutions. I hope they help you
honestly show your clients all project internals and still keep them on board.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>You Do Need Independent Technical Reviews!</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Do you have a team of brilliant and enthusiastic programmers? Of course! You’ve carefully
chosen them from a hundred candidates! Are they passionate about the product?
Absolutely! They use cutting-edge technologies, never sleep, and hardly eat or drink
anything except coffee! Do they believe in your business success? No doubts about it;
they live and breathe all those features, releases, continuous delivery, user
experience, etc. Are you sure they are developing the product &lt;em&gt;correctly&lt;/em&gt;?
Well, yes, you’re pretty sure; why wouldn’t they? …&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Immutability Helps</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;In a few recent posts, including
&lt;a href=&quot;/2014/09/16/getters-and-setters-are-evil.html&quot;&gt;Getters/Setters. Evil. Period.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/2014/06/09/objects-should-be-immutable.html&quot;&gt;Objects Should Be Immutable&lt;/a&gt;, and
&lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/03/di-containers-are-evil.html&quot;&gt;Dependency Injection Containers are Code Polluters&lt;/a&gt;,
I universally labeled all mutable objects with “setters” (object methods starting with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;set&lt;/code&gt;) evil.
My argumentation was based mostly on metaphors and abstract examples. Apparently,
this wasn’t convincing enough for many of you—I received a few requests
asking to provide more specific and practical examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, in order to illustrate my strongly negative attitude to “mutability via setters,” I took
an existing &lt;a href=&quot;http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-email/&quot;&gt;commons-email&lt;/a&gt; Java library from Apache
and re-designed it my way, without setters and with “object thinking” in mind.
I released my library as part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jcabi.com&quot;&gt;jcabi&lt;/a&gt; family—&lt;a href=&quot;https://email.jcabi.com&quot;&gt;jcabi-email&lt;/a&gt;. Let’s see what benefits
we get from a “pure” object-oriented and immutable approach, without getters.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What Does a Software Architect Do?</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Do you have a software architect in your project? Do you need one?
Well, most &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/21/ringelmann-effect-vs-agile.html&quot;&gt;agile teams&lt;/a&gt;
do not define such a role explicitly and
work in a &lt;em&gt;democratic&lt;/em&gt; mode. Every important technical decision
&lt;a href=&quot;/2023/08/15/decision-making-process.html&quot;&gt;is discussed&lt;/a&gt; 
with the entire team, and the most voted for solution wins.
When such a team eventually decides to put a “software architect” badge
on someone’s t-shirt, the most &lt;em&gt;reputable&lt;/em&gt; programmer gets it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Continuous Integration is Dead</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, my article
&lt;a href=&quot;http://devops.com/blogs/continuous-integration-doesnt-work/&quot;&gt;Why Continuous Integration Doesn’t Work&lt;/a&gt;
was published at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.devops.com&quot;&gt;DevOps.com&lt;/a&gt;. Almost the same
day I received a few strongly negative critiques on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is my response to the un-asked question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Why the hell shouldn’t continuous integration work, being such a brilliant and popular idea?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though I have some experience in this area, I won’t use it as an argument.
I’ll try to rely only on logic instead.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Stop Chatting, Start Coding</title>

&lt;p&gt;The first principle of eXtremely Distributed Software Development
(&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xdsd.org&quot;&gt;XDSD&lt;/a&gt;) states that
“everyone gets paid for verified deliverables.” This literally
means that, in order to get paid, every programmer
has to write the code, commit it to the repository,
pass a code review and make sure the code is
&lt;a href=&quot;/2014/07/21/read-only-master-branch.html&quot;&gt;merged into the destination branch&lt;/a&gt;.
Only then, is his result appreciated and paid for.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Project Lifecycle in Zerocracy</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;In addition to being a hands-on programmer, I’m also co-founder and CTO of
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerocracy.com&quot;&gt;Zerocracy&lt;/a&gt;, a custom software development company.
I play the role of a technical and management leader in all projects
we work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerocracy.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;//www.0crat.com/svg/logo.svg&quot; style=&quot;width:100px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote this article for those who’re interested in hiring me and/or
my team. This article will demonstrate what happens from day one until
the end of the project, when you choose to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.0crat.com/join&quot;&gt;work with us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will see below that our methods of
software development &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/17/how-xdsd-is-different.html&quot;&gt;seriously differ&lt;/a&gt;
from what many other teams are using. I personally pay a lot of attention to
&lt;a href=&quot;/2017/04/11/flexibility-equates-lower-quality.html&quot;&gt;quality&lt;/a&gt;
of code and quality of the internal processes that connect our team.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Best Hosted Continuous Integration Services for a Private Repository</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Every project I’m working with starts with a setup of
&lt;a href=&quot;/2016/08/01/continuous-integration-maturity.html&quot;&gt;continuous integration&lt;/a&gt;
pipeline. I’m a big fan of cloud services,
that’s why I was always using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.travis-ci.org&quot;&gt;Travis&lt;/a&gt;. A few of
my clients questioned this choice recently, mostly because
of the price. So I decided to make a brief analysis of the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I configured &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256/rultor&quot;&gt;Rultor&lt;/a&gt;,
an open source project, in every CI service I managed to find.
All of them are free for open source projects.
All of them are hosted and do not require any server installation
Here they are, in order of my personal preference (first four are
the best and highly recommended):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col class=&quot;x-col1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;col class=&quot;x-col2&quot; /&gt;
&lt;col class=&quot;x-colX&quot; /&gt;
&lt;col class=&quot;x-colX&quot; /&gt;
&lt;col class=&quot;x-colX&quot; /&gt;
&lt;col class=&quot;x-colX&quot; /&gt;
&lt;col class=&quot;x-colX&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;

  &lt;td class=&quot;x-vertical&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Windows&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

        <title>Built-in Fake Objects</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;While mock objects are perfect instruments for unit testing,
mocking through mock frameworks may turn your unit tests into
an unmaintainable mess. Thanks to them we often hear that
“mocking is bad” and “mocking is evil.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The root cause of this complexity is that our objects
are too big. They have many methods and these methods
return other objects, which also have methods. When we pass
a mock version of such an object as a parameter, we should
make sure that all of its methods return valid objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leads to inevitable complexity, which turns unit tests
to &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7353767&quot;&gt;waste&lt;/a&gt;
almost impossible to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Getters/Setters. Evil. Period.</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;There is an old debate, started in 2003 by Allen Holub
in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.javaworld.com/article/2073723/core-java/why-getter-and-setter-methods-are-evil.html&quot;&gt;Why getter and setter methods are evil&lt;/a&gt;
famous article, about whether getters/setters is an
&lt;a href=&quot;/2016/02/03/design-patterns-and-anti-patterns.html&quot;&gt;anti-pattern&lt;/a&gt;
and should be avoided or if it is something we inevitably need in object-oriented
programming. I’ll try to add my two cents to this discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gist of the following text is this: getters and setters is
a terrible practice and those who use it can’t be excused.
Again, to avoid any misunderstanding, I’m not saying that get/set should be avoided when possible.
No. I’m saying that you should &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; have them near your code.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Deployment Script vs. Rultor</title>
        
          <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rultor.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://doc.rultor.com/images/logo.svg&quot; style=&quot;width:100px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I explain how &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rultor.com&quot;&gt;Rultor&lt;/a&gt; automates deployment/release processes,
very often I hear something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But I already have a script that deploys everything automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This response is very common, so I decided to summarize my three main arguments for
automated Rultor deployment/release processes in one article: 1) isolated docker containers,
2) visibility of logs and 3) security of credentials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read about them and see what Rultor gives you on top of &lt;strong&gt;your existing&lt;/strong&gt;
deployment script(s).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>RESTful API and a Web Site in the Same URL</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Look at GitHub RESTful API, for example. To get information
about a repository you should make a GET request to
&lt;a href=&quot;https://api.github.com/repos/yegor256/rultor&quot;&gt;api.github.com/repos/yegor256/rultor&lt;/a&gt;.
In response, you will get a JSON document with all the details of the
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;yegor256/rultor&lt;/code&gt; repository. Try it, the URL doesn’t require any authentication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To open the same repository in a nice HTML+CSS page, you should use
a different URL: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256/rultor&quot;&gt;github.com/yegor256/rultor&lt;/a&gt;.
The URL is different, the server-side is definitely different, but the
nature of the data is exactly the same. The only thing that changes is
a representation layer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first case, we get JSON; in the second—HTML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about combining them? How about using the same URL and the same
server-side processing mechanism for both of them? How about shifting the whole rendering task
to the client-side (the browser) and letting the server work solely with
the data?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Simple Java SSH Client</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;An execution of a shell command via SSH can be done in
Java, in just a few lines, using &lt;a href=&quot;https://ssh.jcabi.com&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jcabi-ssh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;hello&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Shell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;Plain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;exec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;echo &apos;Hello, world!&apos;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

a convenient wrapper of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jcraft.com/jsch/&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;JSch&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
a well-known pure Java implementation of SSH2.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Release to Maven Central, in One Click</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;When I release a new version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://aspects.jcabi.com&quot;&gt;jcabi-aspects&lt;/a&gt;,
a Java open source library, to Maven Central, it takes 30 seconds of my time.
Maybe even less. Recently, I released version 0.17.2. You can see
how it all happened, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jcabi/jcabi-aspects/issues/80&quot;&gt;GitHub issue #80&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;unprintable&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2014/08/github-ticket-80.jpg&quot; itemprop=&quot;image&quot; style=&quot;width:600px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;The figure&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you see, I gave a command to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rultor.com&quot;&gt;Rultor&lt;/a&gt;,
and it released a new version to Maven central. I didn’t do anything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s see how you can do the same. How you can configure your project
so that the release of its new version to Maven Central
takes just a few seconds of your time.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Objects Should Be Immutable</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;In object-oriented programming, an object is
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object&quot;&gt;immutable&lt;/a&gt; if its state can’t be
modified after it is created.
In Java, a good example of an
immutable &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/07/14/who-is-object.html&quot;&gt;object&lt;/a&gt;
is &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
Once created, we can’t modify its state. We can request that it creates
new strings, but its own state will never change.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Java Method Logging with AOP and Annotations</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, I want to log (through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.slf4j.org&quot;&gt;slf4j&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&quot;http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/&quot;&gt;log4j&lt;/a&gt;) every execution
of a method, seeing what arguments it receives, what
it returns and how much time every execution takes.
This is how I’m doing it, with help of &lt;a href=&quot;http://eclipse.org/aspectj/&quot;&gt;AspectJ&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://aspects.jcabi.com&quot;&gt;jcabi-aspects&lt;/a&gt; and Java 6
&lt;a href=&quot;/2016/04/12/java-annotations-are-evil.html&quot;&gt;annotations&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Foo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;power&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;pow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what I see in log4j output:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-text highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;[INFO] com.example.Foo #power(2, 10): 1024 in 12μs
[INFO] com.example.Foo #power(3, 3): 27 in 4μs
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice, isn’t it? Now, let’s see how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why NULL is Bad?</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;A simple example of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; usage in Java:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Employee&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;getByName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;database&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;find&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Employee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is wrong with this method?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>OOP Alternative to Utility Classes</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;A utility class (aka helper class) is a “structure” that has only static methods
and encapsulates no state. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;StringUtils&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;IOUtils&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;FileUtils&lt;/code&gt; from
&lt;a href=&quot;http://commons.apache.org/&quot;&gt;Apache Commons&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Iterables&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Iterators&lt;/code&gt; from
&lt;a href=&quot;https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/&quot;&gt;Guava&lt;/a&gt;, and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/Files.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Files&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
from JDK7 are perfect examples of utility classes.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Typical Mistakes in Java Code</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;This page contains most typical mistakes I see in the Java code of people
working with me. Static analysis (we’re using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.qulice.com&quot;&gt;qulice&lt;/a&gt;
can’t catch all of the mistakes for obvious reasons, and that’s why I decided to
list them all here.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Much Do You Pay Per&amp;nbsp;Line&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;Code?</title>
        
          <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;badge&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xdsd.org&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.xdsd.org/images/logo.svg&quot; style=&quot;width:100px;max-width:100%;&quot; alt=&quot;badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I know, “line of code” (LoC)
is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/966800/mythical-man-month-10-lines-per-developer-day-how-close-on-large-projects&quot;&gt;very wrong metric&lt;/a&gt;.
There are &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.codinghorror.com/diseconomies-of-scale-and-lines-of-code/&quot;&gt;tons of articles&lt;/a&gt;
written about it, as well as famous books.
However, I want to compare two projects in which I have participated recently
and discuss some very interesting numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
