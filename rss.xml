      <title>How to Protect a Business Idea While Outsourcing</title>
      <link>http://www.yegor256.com/2015/05/04/how-to-protect-business-idea.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When you hire a programmer or a team of programmers to implement your
business idea, there is a significant risk of theft and accidental loss. They
may implement your idea (or its elements) without you using their own
resources. Also, they may disclose it to their friends, and those friends
may disclose it even further, until it is eventually implemented by
someone you don&amp;#39;t even know. This happens a lot &amp;mdash; and everywhere. I&amp;#39;ve
been on both sides. Here is my experience and a few recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='http://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/05/there-will-be-blood.jpg' style='width:600px;' alt='There Will Be Blood (2007) by Paul Thomas Anderson'/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;There Will Be Blood (2007) by Paul Thomas Anderson&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are basically a few levels of protection you can obtain, and they are
listed below, from the simplest and least secure to the most expensive and
most secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very often, a software team you outsource programming to is located offshore
in a developing country where people care about laws much less than
in, say, the United States; corruption makes it possible for them to get away
with ignoring almost any violation. Let&amp;#39;s not forget this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re not discussing here the risk of losing a product. This also happens
very often &amp;mdash; your programmers start working for you, you pay them,
they show you something, and then things go south. You find yourself in conflict
with them, and they don&amp;#39;t deliver you anything; they ask for extra money instead.
You end up with nothing or something that is broken and can&amp;#39;t be put on the market.
This is yet another risk, which I&amp;#39;ll try to describe in another article soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, we&amp;#39;re talking specifically about a situation where your
programmers are using your idea to implement something similar on their own.
Let&amp;#39;s say you want to create a new search engine that would be smarter and
more accurate than Google. You disclose your alrogithms to a group of
talented programmers and they just implement it on their own. You already
gave them a multi-billion-dollar idea; why would they work for you on the
payroll if they can create their own startup? This is the question you,
as a savvy entrepreneur, must be prepared to answer for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, I&amp;#39;m not a lawyer; I&amp;#39;m speaking here from practical experience only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;non-disclosure-agreement-(nda)&quot;&gt;Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first and easiest step is a so-called NDA. Here is a very simple
and useful example of one, from
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/sample-confidentiality-agreement-nda-33343.html&quot;&gt;NOLO&lt;/a&gt;.
You put the name of your programmers into the document and ask them to sign it.
They won&amp;#39;t object, and you get a piece of paper with a signature; what&amp;#39;s next?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I&amp;#39;m a programmer, the document basically states that whatever you disclose
to me, I should keep in secret and never &amp;quot;use for my own benefit, publish, copy,
or otherwise disclose to others.&amp;quot; If you then give me your Google-killer idea
and I create my own product using its key principles, what will be your next steps?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a court of law in your country, you will have to prove that:
1) you disclosed your idea to me, 2) I used it to create the product,
3) I didn&amp;#39;t know about this idea beforehand, and 4) I didn&amp;#39;t invent it myself.
Until all of these criteria are proven, I&amp;#39;m innocent and &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; product is online, working
and attracting customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will you be able to prove that you disclosed the idea to me? Probably, if
you sent me some documents. If you discussed it with me over the phone, you
won&amp;#39;t prove anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will you be able to prove that your exact idea was used in my product?
How will it technically be possible if I don&amp;#39;t disclose the source code?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can you prove that I didn&amp;#39;t know about something similar before meeting you?
Or maybe I was thinking about it on my own. Or I read about it somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if I disclose your idea to my friends and they create a product? Will
you be able to prove the fact of that disclosure?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many such questions. My point is that a signed NDA
is a very weak protection. It&amp;#39;s more like a lock on the bathroom door
&amp;mdash; anyone can break it with a kick from their leg, but for those with
good manners, it&amp;#39;s a sign that the restroom is occupied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;non-compete-clause-(ncc)&quot;&gt;Non-Compete Clause (NCC)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next level of protection is an agreement with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-compete_clause&quot;&gt;Non-Compete Clause&lt;/a&gt;,
which explicitly prohibits me from engaging in the business that your
idea is about. For example, it may sound like this: &amp;quot;The developer
is not allowed to participate in any businesses related to online searching
for five years.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will I sign this agreement? It depends. But if I show any reluctance
in signing it, you should think twice about my real intentions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will this NCC protect you if I disclose your idea to my friends and they
implement it? No, it won&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I would recommend you put some explicit liability numbers into the
agreement. For example, it may sound like
&amp;quot;a minimum penalty for a proven breach of the non-compete clause is $50,000&amp;quot;.
In my experience, such explicit statements make contracts much more
valuable and help prevent them from being violated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;copyright&quot;&gt;Copyright&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copyright is where the government starts to protect you, but you have to
pay us for it (by &amp;quot;us&amp;quot; I mean all of us, the society). Well, at least in
the United States. In the United Kingdom, it&amp;#39;s free, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., you go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.copyright.gov&quot;&gt;copyright.gov&lt;/a&gt;,
click &amp;quot;register a copyright&amp;quot;,
fill in an online form,
post the description of your business idea in a plain text file,
pay $35, and you&amp;#39;re done.
In a few months, you will receive a confirmation that your &amp;quot;record&amp;quot;
is registered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does it give you? In a court of law, you can claim that this idea
came to your mind on that specific date. Everyone who later made something
similar &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; stole it from you, including me, your programmer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will you be able to prove that my product is actually based on your idea
and steals it? Maybe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not a very strong protection either, but I would recommend you do it
together with an NDA and NCC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;patent&quot;&gt;Patent&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A patent is the best you can get to protect your idea. A patent is basically
a guarantee of safety that you buy from the government. To get that
guarantee, you have to do three things: 1) explain what exactly will be protected,
2) prove that it doesn&amp;#39;t belong to someone else, and 3) pay your dues regularly.
It&amp;#39;s very similar to what gangsters do when they &amp;quot;protect&amp;quot; you,
but here we&amp;#39;re dealing with intellectual property and there is only one
&amp;quot;gangster&amp;quot; per country :) The concept is pretty much the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class='badge'&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1413320449/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1413320449&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=yegor256com-20&amp;amp;linkId=46F452ALSAXMPSW7'&gt;&lt;img src='http://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/04/nolo-patent-it-yourself.jpg' style='width:96px;' alt='badge'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, you describe your idea in the format that patents are written. It is
not difficult at all, but it would help if you read one of those &amp;quot;how to file
a patent&amp;quot; books. I recommend
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1413320449/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1413320449&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=yegor256com-20&amp;amp;linkId=46F452ALSAXMPSW7&quot;&gt;Patent It Yourself: Your Step-by-Step Guide to Filing at the U.S. Patent Office&lt;/a&gt;
by David Pressman and Thomas J. Tuytschaevers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your application will likely amount to about 10 pages and should take a few days
of your time if you know your idea well. No need to hire any attorneys; that&amp;#39;s a
waste of money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you should do some research to make sure something similar already
exists &amp;mdash; but not exactly the same. For example, you can find Google patents
for searching algorithms and mention them in your patent in the list
of references.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, you pay $425 (if you&amp;#39;re a small company) and submit it to the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uspto.gov&quot;&gt;USPTO&lt;/a&gt;. There is also an option to file a &amp;quot;provisional&amp;quot;
patent, but I would recommend you not do this, as it&amp;#39;s just an extra hassle. Simply
file a normal one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;#39;ve paid, your protection starts immediately. If I create a product
that uses the idea described in your patent, you can bring me to court
and ask me to share my profit with you. You will claim that I was making
money by using your brilliant idea, and now it&amp;#39;s time to share that success.
Legally speaking, you will
accuse me of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_infringement&quot;&gt;patent infringement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I will try to invalidate your patent, claiming that something
similar already existed before you filed a patent, called
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_art&quot;&gt;prior art&lt;/a&gt;. If I succeed, the USPTO will
invalidate your patent without a refund, and I&amp;#39;ll walk away, paying you nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I fail, I&amp;#39;ll try to prove that I didn&amp;#39;t infringe on your patent. I will say
that my product is not using your ideas but rather is designed with something else
in mind, just like Samsung &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc._v._Samsung_Electronics_Co.&quot;&gt;did&lt;/a&gt;.
Maybe I&amp;#39;ll win, but my chances will be low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, in a few years, you will receive a patent from the USPTO and put it on the shelf.
You will then have to pay $480 more. Also, at the end of three years, you will have to pay $800 just
to keep your guarantee alive. That escalates to $1,800 in seven years and $3,700 in 11 years
(see the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uspto.gov/learning-and-resources/fees-and-payment/uspto-fee-schedule&quot;&gt;fee schedule&lt;/a&gt;).
Told you; just like gangsters :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize, getting a patent is the best instrument available at the moment
in developed countries that can protect your business idea.
However, as Apple vs. Samsung &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc._v._Samsung_Electronics_Co.&quot;&gt;lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; demonstrates,
it is not a 100 percent guarantee either.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Implement an Iterating Adapter</title>
      <link>http://www.yegor256.com/2015/04/30/iterating-adapter.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Iterator.html&quot;&gt;Iterator&lt;/a&gt;
is one of the fundamental Java interfaces, introduced in Java 1.2. It is supposed
to be very simple; however, in my experience, many Java developers don&amp;#39;t understand
how to implement a custom one, which should iterate a stream of data
coming from some other source. In other words, it becomes an &lt;strong&gt;adapter&lt;/strong&gt; of
another source of data, in the form of an iterator. I hope this example will help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s say we have an object of this class:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;byte&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;read&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we call &lt;code&gt;read()&lt;/code&gt;, it returns a new array of bytes that were retrieved
from somewhere. If there is nothing to retrieve, the array will be empty. Now,
we want to create an &lt;em&gt;adapter&lt;/em&gt; that would consume the bytes and let
us iterate them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;FluentData&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Iterator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Byte&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;hasNext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;/* ... */&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Byte&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;/* ... */&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;remove&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;/* ... */&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is how it should look (it is not thread-safe!):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;FluentData&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Iterator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Byte&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Queue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Byte&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;buffer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;LinkedList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;FluentData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;hasNext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;buffer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;isEmpty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;())&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;byte&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;read&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;())&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;buffer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;buffer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;isEmpty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Byte&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;hasNext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;())&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;NoSuchElementException&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Nothing left&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;buffer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;poll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;remove&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;UnsupportedOperationException&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;It is read-only&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no way to make it thread-safe because the iterating process
is outside the scope of the iterator. Even if we declare our methods
as &lt;code&gt;synchronized&lt;/code&gt;, this won&amp;#39;t guarantee that two threads won&amp;#39;t conflict
when they both call &lt;code&gt;hasNext()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;next()&lt;/code&gt;. So don&amp;#39;t bother with it and
just document the iterator as not thread-safe, then let its users
synchronize one level higher when necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My Favorite Software Books</title>
      <link>http://www.yegor256.com/2015/04/22/favorite-software-books.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of books about software engineering, but only a few of them rank
among my favorites. I read all of those that do over and over again, and I might
just update this post in the future when I stumble upon something else that&amp;#39;s decent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that I tried to put the most important books at the top of the list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class='badge'&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0735619654/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0735619654&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=yegor256com-20&amp;amp;linkId=T5AHAWGQIY5ZZK2Z'&gt;&lt;img src='http://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/04/book-object-thinking.jpg' style='width:96px;' alt='badge'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0735619654/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0735619654&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=yegor256com-20&amp;amp;linkId=T5AHAWGQIY5ZZK2Z&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Object Thinking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
by David West.
This is the best book I&amp;#39;ve read about object-oriented
programming, and it totally changed my understanding of it. I would
recommend you read it a few times. But before reading, try to forget everything
you&amp;#39;ve heard about programming in the past. Try to start from scratch. Maybe it will
work for you too :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class='badge'&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1932735658/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1932735658&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=yegor256com-20&amp;amp;linkId=C6OZC5OD2W2IPLCM'&gt;&lt;img src='http://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/04/book-pmp-rita.jpg' style='width:96px;' alt='badge'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1932735658/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1932735658&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=yegor256com-20&amp;amp;linkId=C6OZC5OD2W2IPLCM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PMP Exam Prep, Eighth Edition: Rita&amp;#39;s Course in a Book for Passing the PMP Exam&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
by Rita Mulcahy.
This book is my favorite for project management. Even though it&amp;#39;s about the
PMI approach and PMBOK in particular, it is a must-read for everyone who
is interested in management. Ignore the PMBOK specifics and focus on
the philosophy of project management and the role of project manager in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class='badge'&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1118031962/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1118031962&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=yegor256com-20&amp;amp;linkId=ZSPUL4X4IBFT6ZVJ'&gt;&lt;img src='http://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/04/book-art-of-testing.jpg' style='width:96px;' alt='badge'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1118031962/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1118031962&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=yegor256com-20&amp;amp;linkId=ZSPUL4X4IBFT6ZVJ&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Art of Software Testing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
by Glenford J. Myers et al.
You can read my short review of this book &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/08/22/art-of-software-testing.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
The book perfectly explains the philosophy of testing and destroys
many typical myths and stereotypes. No matter what your job description is,
if you&amp;#39;re working in the software industry, you should understand testing
and its fundamental principles. This is the only book you need in order to
get that understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class='badge'&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321503627/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0321503627&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=yegor256com-20&amp;amp;linkId=D5KJ4KQEDPXZVQMQ'&gt;&lt;img src='http://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/04/book-goos.jpg' style='width:96px;' alt='badge'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321503627/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0321503627&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=yegor256com-20&amp;amp;linkId=D5KJ4KQEDPXZVQMQ&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
by Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce.
All you need to know about your unit testing is in this book. I&amp;#39;m fully aware
that I didn&amp;#39;t include famous software engineer
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321146530/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0321146530&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=yegor256com-20&amp;amp;linkId=S63Z5BJDORBGMZ2Z&quot;&gt;Kent Beck&amp;#39;s book&lt;/a&gt;
in this list because I don&amp;#39;t like it at all. You definitely should read
it, just to know what&amp;#39;s going on, but it won&amp;#39;t help you write good tests.
Read this one instead, and read it many times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class='badge'&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0131177052/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0131177052&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=yegor256com-20&amp;amp;linkId=D2WNVUW64RHDRGSC'&gt;&lt;img src='http://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/04/book-legacy.jpg' style='width:96px;' alt='badge'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0131177052/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0131177052&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=yegor256com-20&amp;amp;linkId=D2WNVUW64RHDRGSC&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Working Effectively With Legacy Code&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
by Michael Feathers.
This is awesome reading about modern software development, its pitfalls, and
typical failures. Most of the code we&amp;#39;re working on now is legacy (a.k.a. open source).
I read this book as a novel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class='badge'&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321601912/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0321601912&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=yegor256com-20&amp;amp;linkId=MPZUCBXBGNOIHDDI'&gt;&lt;img src='http://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/04/book-continuous-delivery.jpg' style='width:96px;' alt='badge'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321601912/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0321601912&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=yegor256com-20&amp;amp;linkId=MPZUCBXBGNOIHDDI&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continuous Delivery: Reliable Software Releases Through Build, Test, and Deployment Automation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
by Jez Humble and David Farley.
This is a perfect book about software delivery, continuous integration,
testing, packaging, versioning, and many other techniques involved in programming.
It&amp;#39;s definitely a must-read for anyone who is serious about software engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class='badge'&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596007647/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0596007647&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=yegor256com-20&amp;amp;linkId=MWLP356M3CQZSBS7'&gt;&lt;img src='http://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/04/book-xml-nutshell.jpg' style='width:96px;' alt='badge'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596007647/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0596007647&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=yegor256com-20&amp;amp;linkId=MWLP356M3CQZSBS7&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;XML in a Nutshell, Third Edition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
by Elliotte Rusty Harold and W. Scott Means.
XML is my favorite standard. And I hated it before I read this book. I didn&amp;#39;t
understand all the strange prefixes, namespaces, XPath expressions, and
schemas. Just this one book changed everything, and ever since reading it, I&amp;#39;ve used XML
everywhere. It is very well written and easy to read. It&amp;#39;s a must for everybody.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class='badge'&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321349601/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0321349601&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=yegor256com-20&amp;amp;linkId=AN4H5FISUMRSU3XD'&gt;&lt;img src='http://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/04/book-java-concurrency.jpg' style='width:96px;' alt='badge'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321349601/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0321349601&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=yegor256com-20&amp;amp;linkId=AN4H5FISUMRSU3XD&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Java Concurrency in Practice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
by Brian Goetz et al.
This is a very practical book about Java multi-threading, and at the same time,
it provides a lot of theoretical knowledge about concurrency in general. I highly
recommend you read it at least once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class='badge'&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1491903996/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1491903996&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=yegor256com-20&amp;amp;linkId=PUWBN5SFCGEQH3YH'&gt;&lt;img src='http://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/04/book-c++.jpg' style='width:96px;' alt='badge'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1491903996/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1491903996&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=yegor256com-20&amp;amp;linkId=PUWBN5SFCGEQH3YH&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effective Modern C++: 42 Specific Ways to Improve Your Use of C++11 and C++14&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
by Scott Meyers.
No matter what language you&amp;#39;re using, this book is very interesting and
very useful. It makes many important suggestions about better C++ coding. If
you understand most of them, your Java/Ruby/Python/Scala coding skills will
improve significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class='badge'&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0735619670/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0735619670&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=yegor256com-20&amp;amp;linkId=KWY7Y3BVH5URNCK3'&gt;&lt;img src='http://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/04/book-code-complete.jpg' style='width:96px;' alt='badge'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0735619670/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0735619670&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=yegor256com-20&amp;amp;linkId=KWY7Y3BVH5URNCK3&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code Complete: A Practical Handbook of Software Construction, Second Edition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
by Steve McConnell.
Consider this the bible of clean coding. Read it a few times and use it as a reference
manual in debates with your colleagues. It mentions the most terrible anti-patterns
and worst practices you&amp;#39;ll see in modern programming. To be a good programmer,
you must know all of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class='badge'&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JDMPOVQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00JDMPOVQ&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=yegor256com-20&amp;amp;linkId=HDYS46EBUPXYSNDD'&gt;&lt;img src='http://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/04/book-estimation.jpg' style='width:96px;' alt='badge'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JDMPOVQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00JDMPOVQ&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=yegor256com-20&amp;amp;linkId=HDYS46EBUPXYSNDD&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Software Estimation: Demystifying the Black Art&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
by Steve McConnell.
This one&amp;#39;s an interesting read about software engineering and its most tricky part &amp;mdash; estimations.
At the least, read it to be aware of the problem and possible solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class='badge'&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201702258/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0201702258&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=yegor256com-20&amp;amp;linkId=VGRW6G3LUVKEB72C'&gt;&lt;img src='http://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/04/book-use-cases.jpg' style='width:96px;' alt='badge'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201702258/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0201702258&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=yegor256com-20&amp;amp;linkId=VGRW6G3LUVKEB72C&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Writing Effective Use Cases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
by Alistair Cockburn.
An old and very good book, you won&amp;#39;t actually use anything from this in your
real projects, but you will pick up the philosophy of use cases, which will
redirect your mind in the right direction. Don&amp;#39;t take this book as something
practical; these use cases are hardly used anywhere today, but the idea of
scoping functionality this way is absolutely right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class='badge'&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JDMPMOA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00JDMPMOA&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=yegor256com-20&amp;amp;linkId=PRSWJK34HNP355LK'&gt;&lt;img src='http://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/04/book-requirements.jpg' style='width:96px;' alt='badge'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JDMPMOA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00JDMPMOA&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=yegor256com-20&amp;amp;linkId=PRSWJK34HNP355LK&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Software Requirements, Third Edition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
by Karl Wiegers (author) and Joy Beatty.
A superb book about requirements analysis, the first and most important
activity in any software project. Even if you&amp;#39;re not an analyst, this book
is a must-read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class='badge'&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449316387/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1449316387&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=yegor256com-20&amp;amp;linkId=LTNZ7XPLDEG4MEJO'&gt;&lt;img src='http://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/04/book-git.jpg' style='width:96px;' alt='badge'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

by Jon Loeliger and Matthew McCullough.
This title serves as a practical guide for Git, a version control system. Read it from
cover to cover and you will save many hours of your time in the future.
Git is a de-facto standard in version control, and every programmer must
know its fundamental principles &amp;mdash; not from a cheat sheet but from an original source.&lt;/p&gt;

by David Flanagan.
JavaScript is a language of the modern Web, and this book explains it very well.
No matter what kind of software you develop, you must know JavaScript. Don&amp;#39;t read
it as a practical guide (even though it&amp;#39;s called a guide) but rather as
food for thought. JavaScript offers a lot to learn for Java/Ruby/Python developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class='badge'&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00457X7L8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00457X7L8&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=yegor256com-20&amp;amp;linkId=PSW6X7D2VCCBS6OL'&gt;&lt;img src='http://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/04/book-css.jpg' style='width:96px;' alt='badge'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

by Eric A. Meyer.
CSS is not just about colors and shadows, and it&amp;#39;s not only for graphic designers.
CSS is a key language of the modern Web. Every developer must know it, whether
you&amp;#39;re working with a back-end, front-end, or desktop application in C++.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Software Quality Award</title>
      <link>http://www.yegor256.com/award.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a big fan of rules and discipline in software development; as an example, see
&lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/26/hacker-vs-programmer-mentality.html&quot;&gt;Are You a Hacker or a Designer?&lt;/a&gt;.
Also, I&amp;#39;m a big fan of object-oriented programming in its purest form; for example, see
&lt;a href=&quot;/2014/11/20/seven-virtues-of-good-object.html&quot;&gt;Seven Virtues of a Good Object&lt;/a&gt;.
I&amp;#39;m also a co-founder and the CTO of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.teamed.io&quot;&gt;Teamed.io&lt;/a&gt;, a software development
company through which I put my admiration of discipline and clean design into practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to encourage you to share my passion &amp;mdash; not just by reading this blog
but through making real open source software in a disciplined way.
This award is for those who are brave enough to swim against the current and
value quality above everything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Send me your own project for review and participate in the contest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rules:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One person can submit up to three projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Submissions are accepted until the &lt;strong&gt;September 1, 2015&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Submissions must be sent via email to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:me@yegor256.com&quot;&gt;me@yegor256.com&lt;/a&gt;.
All I need is your Github login and repository name; I will check the commit
history to make sure you&amp;#39;re the main contributor to the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I reserve the right to reject any submission without explanation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All submissions will be published on this page (including rejected ones).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results will be announced &lt;strong&gt;October 15&lt;/strong&gt; on this page and by email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best project will receive &lt;strong&gt;$4,096&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Final decisions will be made by me and are not negotiable
(although I may invite other people to help me make the right decision).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each project must be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least 5,000 lines of code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least one year old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Object-oriented (that&amp;#39;s the only thing I understand).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best projects will feature:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strict and visible principles of design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continuous delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traceability of changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Self-documented source code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strict rules of code formatting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What doesn&amp;#39;t matter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Popularity. Even if nobody is using your
product, it is still eligible for this award. I don&amp;#39;t care about
popularity; quality is the key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Programming language. I believe that any language, used correctly,
can be applied to design a high-quality product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buzz and trends. Even if your project is yet another parser of command
line arguments, it&amp;#39;s still eligible for the award. I don&amp;#39;t care about
your marketing position; quality is all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, if you want to sponsor this award,
&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:me@yegor256.com&quot;&gt;email me&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

      <title>Tacit, a CSS Framework Without Classes</title>
      <link>http://www.yegor256.com/2015/04/13/tacit-css-framework-for-dummies.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been using &lt;a href=&quot;http://getbootstrap.com/&quot;&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt;
for more than two years in multiple projects,
and my frustration has been building. First of all, it&amp;#39;s too massive for
a small web app. Second, it is not fully self-sufficient; no matter
how much you follow its principles of design, you end up with your
own CSS styles anyway. Third, and most importantly, its internal
design is messy. Having all this in mind, I created
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256/tacit&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tacit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, my own CSS framework,
which immediately received positive feedback on
&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9345271&quot;&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tacit&lt;/em&gt;, according to Google, means &amp;quot;understood or implied without being stated&amp;quot;.
That&amp;#39;s exactly the idea of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256/tacit&quot;&gt;framework&lt;/a&gt;.
It doesn&amp;#39;t have a single
CSS class and can be applied to any valid HTML5 document. For example, you
have an HTML document:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Subscribe&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;section&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Are you interested in learning more?&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;form&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;label&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Email:&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;email&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;submit&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Subscribe&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/form&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/section&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how it looks in Safari:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='http://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/04/html-in-safari-without-tacit.jpg' style='width:600px;' alt='figure'/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I add &lt;code&gt;tacit.min.css&lt;/code&gt; to it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Subscribe&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;rel=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;stylesheet&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;text/css&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;http://yegor256.github.io/tacit/tacit.min.css&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;section&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Are you interested in learning more?&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;form&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;label&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Email:&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;email&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;text&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;submit&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Subscribe&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/form&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/section&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how it looks in the same Safari browser:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='http://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/04/html-in-safari-with-tacit.jpg' style='width:600px;' alt='figure'/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you got the idea. The HTML itself wasn&amp;#39;t changed at all. All CSS
styles are applied to standard HTML elements. Unlike many other CSS frameworks,
in Tacit you don&amp;#39;t have to mention CSS classes in the HTML document. The HTML
stays clean and only exposes the data in a pure HTML5 way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The HTML document is still readable and usable, but it doesn&amp;#39;t have the
good-looking-graphics component. Tacit adds that component in a non-intrusive
manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, in many projects, the default layout features of Tacit won&amp;#39;t
be enough. In most cases, I still have to add my own CSS classes and inline
styles. But Tacit gives me an adequate foundation to start from. It solves
most of the problems associated with responsiveness of forms, appearance of
form controls, tables, fonts, and colors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tacit allows me to focus on functionality from the first day of a project. And
the functionality immediately looks attractive. I have tried many other
frameworks, including &lt;a href=&quot;http://getbootstrap.com/&quot;&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://imperavi.com/kube/&quot;&gt;Kube&lt;/a&gt;, and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://purecss.io/&quot;&gt;Pure&lt;/a&gt;. None of them are designed with this concept in mind.
They all put CSS in front of HTML. In all of them, CSS is the most important
element of web design, while HTML is something that assists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tacit takes a different approach. In Tacit, HTML is king while CSS is a supportive
element that only makes data look better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Class Casting Is a Discriminating Anti-Pattern</title>
      <link>http://www.yegor256.com/2015/04/02/class-casting-is-anti-pattern.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Type casting is a very useful technique when there is no time
or desire to think and design objects properly. Type casting (or
class casting) helps us work with provided objects differently,
based on the class they belong to or the interface they implement. Class
casting helps us &lt;strong&gt;discriminate&lt;/strong&gt; against the poor objects and &lt;strong&gt;segregate&lt;/strong&gt;
them by their race, gender, and religion. Can this be a good practice?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='http://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/03/gadkiy-utenok.jpg' style='width:600px;' alt='Гадкий утенок (1956) by Владимир Дегтярёв'/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Гадкий утенок (1956) by Владимир Дегтярёв&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a very typical example of type casting (Google Guava is full
of it, for example &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google/guava/blob/v18.0/guava/src/com/google/common/collect/Iterables.java#L104-L111&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Iterables.size()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Foo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;sizeOf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Iterable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;size&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;items&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;instanceof&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Collection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;size&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Collection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;cast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &lt;code&gt;sizeOf()&lt;/code&gt;  method calculates the size of an iterable. However, it
is smart enough to understand that if &lt;code&gt;items&lt;/code&gt; are also instances of &lt;code&gt;Collection&lt;/code&gt;,
there is no need to actually iterate them. It would be much faster to
cast them to &lt;code&gt;Collection&lt;/code&gt; and then call method &lt;code&gt;size()&lt;/code&gt;. Looks logical,
but what&amp;#39;s wrong with this approach? I see two practical problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, there is a &lt;strong&gt;hidden coupling&lt;/strong&gt; of &lt;code&gt;sizeOf()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Collection&lt;/code&gt;. This
coupling is not visible to the clients of &lt;code&gt;sizeOf()&lt;/code&gt;. They don&amp;#39;t know that
method &lt;code&gt;sizeOf()&lt;/code&gt; relies on interface &lt;code&gt;Collection&lt;/code&gt;. If tomorrow we decide
to change it, &lt;code&gt;sizeOf()&lt;/code&gt; won&amp;#39;t work. And we&amp;#39;ll be very surprised, since
its signature says nothing about this dependency. This won&amp;#39;t happen with
&lt;code&gt;Collection&lt;/code&gt;, obviously, since it is part of the Java SDK, but with custom
classes, this may and will happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second problem is an inevitably &lt;strong&gt;growing complexity&lt;/strong&gt; of method &lt;code&gt;sizeOf()&lt;/code&gt;. The
more special types it has to treat differently, the more complex it will become.
This if/then forking is inevitable, since it has to check all possible
types and give them special treatment. Such complexity is a result
of a violation of the single responsibility principle. The method is not
only calculating the size of &lt;code&gt;Iterable&lt;/code&gt; but is also performing type
casting and forking based on that casting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the alternative? There are a few, but the most obvious
is method overloading (not available in semi-OOP languages like Ruby or PHP):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Foo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;sizeOf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Iterable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;size&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;sizeOf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Collection&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isn&amp;#39;t that more elegant?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Philosophically speaking, type casting is discrimination  against the object
that comes into the method. The object complies with the contract provided by the
method signature. It implements the &lt;code&gt;Iterable&lt;/code&gt; interface, which
&lt;a href=&quot;/2014/11/20/seven-virtues-of-good-object.html&quot;&gt;is a contract&lt;/a&gt;,
and it expects equal treatment with all other objects that come into
the same method. But the method discriminates objects by their types.
The method is basically asking the object about its ... race. Black
objects go right while white objects go left. That&amp;#39;s what this &lt;code&gt;instanceof&lt;/code&gt;
is doing, and that&amp;#39;s what discrimination is all about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By using &lt;code&gt;instanceof&lt;/code&gt;, the method is segregating incoming objects by the
certain group they belong to. In this case, there are two groups: collections
and everybody else. If you are a collection, you get special treatment.
Even though you abide by the &lt;code&gt;Iterable&lt;/code&gt; contract, we still treat some objects
specially because they belong to an &amp;quot;elite&amp;quot; group called &lt;code&gt;Collection&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may say that &lt;code&gt;Collection&lt;/code&gt; is just another contract that an object may
comply with. That&amp;#39;s true, but in this case, there should be another door through
which those who work by that contract should enter. You announced that
&lt;code&gt;sizeOf()&lt;/code&gt; accepts everybody who works on the &lt;code&gt;Iterable&lt;/code&gt; contract. I am an object,
and I do what the contract says. I enter the method and expect
equal treatment with everybody else who comes into the same method.
But, apparently, once inside the method, I realize that some objects have
some special privileges. Isn&amp;#39;t that discrimination?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To conclude, I would consider &lt;code&gt;instanceof&lt;/code&gt; and class casting to be
anti-patterns and code smells. Once you see a need to use them,
start thinking about refactoring.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How AppVeyor Helps Me to Validate Pull Requests Before Rultor Merges Them</title>
      <link>http://www.yegor256.com/2015/03/29/rultor-with-appveyor.html</link>
      <description>&lt;figure class='badge'&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.appveyor.com'&gt;&lt;img src='http://www.yegor256.com/images/2014/10/appveyor.png' style='width:100px;' alt='badge'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.appveyor.com&quot;&gt;AppVeyor&lt;/a&gt; is a great cloud continuous integration service that builds
Windows projects. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rultor.com&quot;&gt;Rultor&lt;/a&gt; is a DevOps assistant, which automates
release, merge and deploy operations, using Docker containers. These posts
explain how Rultor works and what it&amp;#39;s for:
&lt;a href=&quot;/2014/07/24/rultor-automated-merging.html&quot;&gt;Rultor.com, a Merging Bot&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/07/21/read-only-master-branch.html&quot;&gt;Master Branch Must Be Read-Only&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class='badge'&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.rultor.com'&gt;&lt;img src='http://doc.rultor.com/images/logo.svg' style='width:100px;' alt='badge'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that Rultor is running all scripts inside Docker containers
and Docker can&amp;#39;t build Windows projects. The only and the best logical solution
is to trigger AppVeyor before running all other scripts in Docker. If AppVeyor
gives a green light, we continue with our usual in-Docker script. Otherwise,
we fail the entire build. Below I explain how this automation was configured
in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.takes.org&quot;&gt;Takes framework&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I got a token from my AppVeyor account (at the time
of writing it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://ci.appveyor.com/api-token&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). I created
a text file &lt;code&gt;curl-appveyor.cfg&lt;/code&gt; with this content (it&amp;#39;s not my real token inside,
just an example):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;--silent
--header &amp;quot;Authorization: Bearer 1hdmsfbs7xccb9x6g1y4&amp;quot;
--header &amp;quot;Content-Type: application/json&amp;quot;
--header &amp;quot;Accept: application/json&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, I encrypted this file, using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256/rultor-remote&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;rultor&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
command line tool:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;rultor encrypt -p yegor256/takes curl-appveyor.cfg&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The file I creaeted was called
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256/takes/blob/master/curl-appveyor.cfg.asc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl-appveyor.cfg.asc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
I committed and pushed into &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256/takes&quot;&gt;yegor256/takes&lt;/a&gt;
Github repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git add curl-appveyor.cfg.asc
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git commit -am &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;CURL config for Appveyor&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git push origin master&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, I configured AppVeyor &amp;quot;pinging&amp;quot; from Docker script.
This is what I did in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256/takes/blob/master/.rultor.yml&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;.rultor.yml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yaml&quot; data-lang=&quot;yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;l-Scalar-Plain&quot;&gt;decrypt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p-Indicator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;l-Scalar-Plain&quot;&gt;curl-appveyor.cfg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p-Indicator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;repo/curl-appveyor.cfg.asc&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;l-Scalar-Plain&quot;&gt;merge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p-Indicator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;l-Scalar-Plain&quot;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p-Indicator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p-Indicator&quot;&gt;|-&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;version=$(curl -K ../curl-appveyor.cfg --data &amp;quot;{accountName: &amp;#39;yegor256&amp;#39;, projectSlug: &amp;#39;takes&amp;#39;, pullRequestId: &amp;#39;${pull_id}&amp;#39;}&amp;quot; https://ci.appveyor.com/api/builds | jq -r &amp;#39;.version&amp;#39;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;while true&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;do status=$(curl -K ../curl-appveyor.cfg https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/yegor256/takes/build/${version} | jq -r &amp;#39;.build.status&amp;#39;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;if [ &amp;quot;${status}&amp;quot; == &amp;quot;success&amp;quot; ]; then break; fi&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;if [ &amp;quot;${status}&amp;quot; == &amp;quot;failed&amp;quot; ]; then echo &amp;quot;see https://ci.appveyor.com/project/yegor256/takes/build/${version}&amp;quot;; exit 1; fi&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;echo &amp;quot;waiting for AppVeyor build ${version}: ${status}&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;sleep 5s&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;mvn clean install&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no magic here, it&amp;#39;s very simple. First, I start a new build
using &lt;code&gt;/api/builds&lt;/code&gt; end-point of
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.appveyor.com/docs/api/projects-builds#start-build-of-pull-request-github-only&quot;&gt;AppVeyor REST API&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;code&gt;${pull_id}&lt;/code&gt; is an environment variable that is coming from Rultor,
it contains an integer number of current pull request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m using &lt;a href=&quot;http://stedolan.github.io/jq/&quot;&gt;jq&lt;/a&gt;
in order to parse AppVeyor JSON output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the build is started, I&amp;#39;m getting its unique &lt;code&gt;version&lt;/code&gt; and start
looping to check its status. I&amp;#39;m waiting for &lt;code&gt;success&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;failed&lt;/code&gt;. Anything
else will mean that the build is still in progress and I should keep looping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see how it works in this pull request, for example:
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256/takes/pull/93&quot;&gt;yegor256/takes#93&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>JAXB Is Doing It Wrong; Try Xembly</title>
      <link>http://www.yegor256.com/2015/03/26/jaxb-vs-xembly.html</link>
      <description>&lt;figure class='badge'&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.xembly.org'&gt;&lt;img src='http://img.xembly.org/logo-256x256.png' style='width:64px;' alt='badge'/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Architecture_for_XML_Binding&quot;&gt;JAXB&lt;/a&gt;
is a 10-year-old Java technology that allows us to
convert a Java object into an XML document (marshalling) and
back (unmarshalling). This technology is based on
&lt;a href=&quot;/2014/09/16/getters-and-setters-are-evil.html&quot;&gt;setters and getters&lt;/a&gt;
and, in my opinion, violates key principles of object-oriented
programming by turning objects into &lt;strong&gt;passive data structures&lt;/strong&gt;. I would
recommend you use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xembly.org&quot;&gt;Xembly&lt;/a&gt;
instead for marshalling Java objects into XML documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how JAXB marshalling works. Say you have a &lt;code&gt;Book&lt;/code&gt; class that needs to be
marshalled into an XML document. You have to create getters and annotate them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlRootElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@XmlRootElement&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Book&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;isbn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Book&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;isbn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;isbn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;isbn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@XmlElement&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;getIsbn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;isbn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@XmlElement&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;getTitle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you create a marshaller and ask it to convert an instance of class
&lt;code&gt;Book&lt;/code&gt; into XML:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Book&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;book&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Book&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;0132350882&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Clean Code&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;JAXBContext&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;context&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;JAXBContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;newInstance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Book&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Marshaller&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;marshaller&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;jaxbContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;createMarshaller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;marshaller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;marshal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;book&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should be expecting something like this in the output:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-xml&quot; data-lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;?xml version=&amp;quot;1.0&amp;quot;?&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;book&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;isbn&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;0132350882&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/isbn&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Clean Code&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/book&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what&amp;#39;s wrong with it? Pretty much the same thing that&amp;#39;s wrong with
object-relational mapping, which is explained in
&lt;a href=&quot;/2014/12/01/orm-offensive-anti-pattern.html&quot;&gt;ORM Is an Offensive Anti-Pattern&lt;/a&gt;.
JAXB is treating an object as a bag of data, extracting the data
and converting it into XML the way JAXB wants. The object has no control
over this process. Therefore an object is not
&lt;a href=&quot;/2014/11/20/seven-virtues-of-good-object.html&quot;&gt;an object&lt;/a&gt;
anymore but rather a passive bag of data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An ideal approach would be to redesign our class &lt;code&gt;Book&lt;/code&gt; this way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Book&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;isbn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Book&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;isbn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;isbn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;isbn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;toXML&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// create XML document and return&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are a few problems with this approach. First of all, there&amp;#39;s
massive code duplication. Building an XML document is a rather verbose
process in Java. If every class had to re-implement it in its
&lt;code&gt;toXML()&lt;/code&gt; method, we would have a big problem with duplicate code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second problem is that we don&amp;#39;t know exactly what type of wrapping
our XML document should be delivered in. It may be a &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; or an &lt;code&gt;InputStream&lt;/code&gt;
or maybe an instance of &lt;code&gt;org.w3c.dom.Document&lt;/code&gt;. Making many &lt;code&gt;toXML()&lt;/code&gt; methods
in each object would definitely be a disaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xembly.org&quot;&gt;Xembly&lt;/a&gt; provides a solution. As I&amp;#39;ve
&lt;a href=&quot;/2014/04/09/xembly-intro.html&quot;&gt;mentioned before&lt;/a&gt;, it is
an imperative language for XML constructions and manipulations. Here is
how we can implement our &lt;code&gt;Book&lt;/code&gt; object with the help of Xembly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;org.xembly.Directive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Book&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;isbn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Book&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;isbn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;isbn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;isbn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Iterable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Directive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;toXembly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Directives&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;book&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;isbn&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;isbn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;up&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;up&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;up&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, in order to build an XML document, we should use this code
outside the object:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Book&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;book&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Book&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;0132350882&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Clean Code&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;xml&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Xembler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;book&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;toXembly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;xml&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xembly.org/apidocs-0.21/org/xembly/Xembler.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Xembler&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
class will convert Xembly directives into an XML document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beauty of this solution is that the internals of the object are
not exposed via getters and the object is fully in charge of the XML
marshalling process. In addition, the compexity of these directives
may be very high &amp;mdash; much higher than the rather cumbersome annotations of JAXB.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Java Web App Architecture In Takes Framework</title>
      <link>http://www.yegor256.com/2015/03/22/takes-java-web-framework.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I used to utilize Servlets, JSP, JAX-RS, Spring Framework, Play Framework,
JSF with Facelets, and a bit of Spark Framework. All of these solutions,
in my humble opinion, are very far from being object-oriented and elegant.
They all are full of static methods, untestable data structures, and
dirty hacks. So about a month ago, I decided to create my own Java web
framework. I put a few basic principles into its foundation: 1) No NULLs,
2) no public static methods, 3) no mutable classes, and 4) no class casting, reflection,
and &lt;code&gt;instanceof&lt;/code&gt; operators. These four basic principles should guarantee
clean code and transparent architecture. That&amp;#39;s how the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.takes.org&quot;&gt;Takes&lt;/a&gt; framework was born.
Let&amp;#39;s see what was created and how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='http://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/03/godfather-shooting-scene.jpg' style='width:600px;' alt='Making of The Godfather (1972) by Francis Ford Coppola'/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Making of The Godfather (1972) by Francis Ford Coppola&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;java-web-architecture-in-a-nutshell&quot;&gt;Java Web Architecture in a Nutshell&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how I understand a web application architecture and its
components, in simple terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, to create a web server, we should create
a new &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_socket&quot;&gt;network socket&lt;/a&gt;,
that accepts connections on a certain &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_%28computer_networking%29&quot;&gt;TCP port&lt;/a&gt;.
Usually it is 80, but I&amp;#39;m going to use 8080 for testing purposes.
This is done in Java with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/net/ServerSocket.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ServerSocket&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; class:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;java.net.ServerSocket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Foo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ServerSocket&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;server&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ServerSocket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;8080&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s enough to start a web server. Now, the socket is ready and listening
on port 8080. When someone opens &lt;code&gt;http://localhost:8080&lt;/code&gt; in their browser,
the connection will be established and the browser will spin its waiting
wheel forever. Compile this snippet and try. We just built a simple web
server without the use of any frameworks. We&amp;#39;re not doing anything with
incoming connections yet, but we&amp;#39;re not rejecting them either. All of them
are being lined up inside that &lt;code&gt;server&lt;/code&gt; object. It&amp;#39;s being done in a background
thread; that&amp;#39;s why we need to put that &lt;code&gt;while(true)&lt;/code&gt; in afterward. Without this endless pause,
the app will finish its execution immediately and the server socket will
shut down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step is to accept the incoming connections. In Java, that&amp;#39;s done through
a blocking call to the &lt;code&gt;accept()&lt;/code&gt; method:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Socket&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;socket&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;server&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;accept&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The method is blocking its thread and waiting until a new connection arrives. As
soon as that happens, it returns an instance of &lt;code&gt;Socket&lt;/code&gt;. In order to accept
the next connection, we should call &lt;code&gt;accept()&lt;/code&gt; again. So basically, our
web server should work like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Foo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ServerSocket&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;server&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ServerSocket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;8080&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Socket&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;socket&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;server&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;accept&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// 1. Read HTTP request from the socket&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// 2. Prepare an HTTP response&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// 3. Send HTTP response to the socket&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// 4. Close the socket&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s an endless cycle that accepts a new connection, understands it,
creates a response, returns the response, and accepts a new connection again.
HTTP protocol is stateless, which means the server should not
remember what happened in any previous connection. All it cares about is
the incoming HTTP request in this particular connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The HTTP request is coming from the input stream of the socket and looks like
a multi-line block of text. This is what you would see if you read
an input stream of the socket:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;BufferedReader&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;reader&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;BufferedReader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;InputStreamReader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;socket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getInputStream&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;line&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;reader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;readLine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;isEmpty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;())&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will see something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8080
Connection: keep-alive
Cache-Control: max-age=0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_10_2) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/41.0.2272.89 Safari/537.36
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, sdch
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8,ru;q=0.6,uk;q=0.4&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The client (the Google Chrome browser, for example) passes this text into the
connection established. It connects to port 8080 at &lt;code&gt;localhost&lt;/code&gt;, and as soon
as the connection is ready, it immediately sends this text into it, then waits
for a response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our job is to create an HTTP response using the information we get in the
request. If our server is very primitive, we can basically ignore all the
information in the request and just return &amp;quot;Hello, world!&amp;quot; to all requests
(I&amp;#39;m using
&lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-io/apidocs/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;IOUtils&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
for simplicity):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;java.net.Socket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;java.net.ServerSocket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Foo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ServerSocket&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;server&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ServerSocket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;8080&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Socket&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;socket&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;server&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;accept&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;())&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IOUtils&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;copy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IOUtils&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;toInputStream&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n\r\nHello, world!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;socket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getOutputStream&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s it. The server is ready. Try to compile and run it. Point your browser
to &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:8080&quot;&gt;http://localhost:8080&lt;/a&gt;, and you will see &lt;code&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;javac -cp commons-io.jar Foo.java
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;java -cp commons-io.jar:. Foo &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;curl http://localhost:8080 -v
* Rebuilt URL to: http://localhost:8080/

Hello, world!&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s all you need to build a web server. Now let&amp;#39;s discuss how to make
it object-oriented and composable. Let&amp;#39;s try to see how the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.takes.org&quot;&gt;Takes&lt;/a&gt;
framework was built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;routing/dispatching&quot;&gt;Routing/Dispatching&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Routing/dispatching is combined with response printing in Takes. All you
need to do to create a working web application is to create a single
class that implements
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.takes.org/apidocs-0.9/org/takes/Take.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Take&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; interface:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;org.takes.Request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;org.takes.Take&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;TkFoo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Take&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Override&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;route&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Request&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;RsText&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Hello, world!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now it&amp;#39;s time to start a server:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;org.takes.http.Exit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;org.takes.http.FtBasic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Foo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;FtBasic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;TkFoo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;8080&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Exit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;NEVER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.takes.org/apidocs-0.9/org/takes/http/FtBasic.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;FtBasic&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
class does the exact same socket manipulations explained
above. It starts a server socket on port 8080 and dispatches all incoming
connections through an instance of &lt;code&gt;TkFoo&lt;/code&gt; that we are giving to its constructor.
It does this dispatching in an endless cycle, checking every second whether
it&amp;#39;s time to stop with an instance of
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.takes.org/apidocs-0.9/org/takes/http/Exit.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Exit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
Obviously, &lt;code&gt;Exit.NEVER&lt;/code&gt; always responds with, &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t stop, please&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;http-request&quot;&gt;HTTP Request&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;#39;s see what&amp;#39;s inside the HTTP request arriving at &lt;code&gt;TsFoo&lt;/code&gt; and what
we can get out of it. This is how the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.takes.org/apidocs-0.9/org/takes/Request.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Request&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
interface is defined in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.takes.org&quot;&gt;Takes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Request&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Iterable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IOException&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;InputStream&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IOException&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The request is divided into two parts: the head and the body. The head
contains all lines that go before the empty line that starts
a body, according to HTTP specification in
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec5.html&quot;&gt;RFC 2616&lt;/a&gt;. There are many useful
decorators for &lt;code&gt;Request&lt;/code&gt; in the framework. For example, &lt;code&gt;RqMethod&lt;/code&gt; will
help you get the method name from the first line of the header:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;method&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;RqMethod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;method&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;RqHref&lt;/code&gt; will help extract the query part and parse it. For example,
this is the request:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;GET&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;123&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;1.1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;Host:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;www&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;example&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This code will extract that &lt;code&gt;123&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Integer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;parseInt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;RqHref&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;param&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;RqPrint&lt;/code&gt; can get the entire request or its body printed as a &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;RqPrint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;printBody&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea here is to keep the &lt;code&gt;Request&lt;/code&gt; interface simple and provide
this request parsing functionality to its decorators. This approach helps the
framework keep classes small and cohesive. Each decorator is very
small and solid, doing exactly one thing. All of these decorators
are in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.takes.org/apidocs-0.9/org/takes/rq/index.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;org.takes.rq&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; package.
As you already probably understand, the &lt;code&gt;Rq&lt;/code&gt; prefix stands for &lt;code&gt;Request&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;first-real-web-app&quot;&gt;First Real Web App&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s create our first real web application, which will do something
useful. I would recommend starting with an &lt;code&gt;Entry&lt;/code&gt; class, which is
required by Java to start an app from the command line:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;org.takes.http.Exit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;org.takes.http.FtCLI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Entry&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;FtCLI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;TkApp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Exit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;NEVER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This class contains just a single &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; static method that will be
called by JVM when the app starts from the command line. As you see, it
instantiates &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.takes.org/apidocs-0.9/org/takes/http/FtCLI.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;FtCLI&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
giving it an instance of class &lt;code&gt;TkApp&lt;/code&gt; and command
line arguments. We&amp;#39;ll create the &lt;code&gt;TkApp&lt;/code&gt; class in a second. &lt;code&gt;FtCLI&lt;/code&gt;
(translates to &amp;quot;front-end with command line interface&amp;quot;) makes an instance
of the same &lt;code&gt;FtBasic&lt;/code&gt;, wrapping it into a few useful decorators and configuring
it according to command line arguments. For example, &lt;code&gt;--port=8080&lt;/code&gt; will
be converted into a &lt;code&gt;8080&lt;/code&gt; port number and passed as a second argument of
the &lt;code&gt;FtBasic&lt;/code&gt; constructor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The web application itself is called &lt;code&gt;TkApp&lt;/code&gt; and extends &lt;code&gt;TsWrap&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;org.takes.Take&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;org.takes.facets.fork.FkRegex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;org.takes.facets.fork.TkFork&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;org.takes.tk.TkWrap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;org.takes.tk.TkClasspath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;TkApp&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;TkWrap&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;TkApp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;TkApp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;make&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Take&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;make&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;TkFork&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;FkRegex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;/robots.txt&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;FkRegex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;/css/.*&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;TkClasspath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()),&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;FkRegex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;/&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;TkIndex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ll discuss this &lt;code&gt;TkFork&lt;/code&gt; class in a minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re using Maven, this is the &lt;code&gt;pom.xml&lt;/code&gt; you should start with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;xml&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;version&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;1.0&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;?&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;project&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;xmlns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;xmlns:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;xsi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;xsi:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;schemaLocation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;plugins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;plugin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;artifactId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;maven&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dependency&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;plugin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;artifactId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;goals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;configuration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;outputDirectory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;project&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;build&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;directory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;deps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;outputDirectory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;configuration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;execution&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;executions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;plugin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;plugins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;build&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;project&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running &lt;code&gt;mvn clean package&lt;/code&gt; should build a &lt;code&gt;foo.jar&lt;/code&gt; file in &lt;code&gt;target&lt;/code&gt; directory
and a collection of all JAR dependencies in &lt;code&gt;target/deps&lt;/code&gt;. Now you
can run the app from the command line:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;mvn clean package
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;java -Dfile.encoding&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;UTF-8 -cp ./target/foo.jar:./target/deps/* foo.Entry --port&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;8080&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application is ready, and you can deploy it to, say, Heroku. Just
create a &lt;code&gt;Procfile&lt;/code&gt; file in the root of the repository and push the repo
to Heroku. This is what &lt;code&gt;Procfile&lt;/code&gt; should look like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;web: java -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -cp target/foo.jar:target/deps/* foo.Entry --port=${PORT}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tkfork&quot;&gt;TkFork&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.takes.org/apidocs-0.9/org/takes/facets/fork/TkFork.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;TkFork&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
class seems to be one of the core elements of the framework. It
helps route an incoming HTTP request to the right &lt;em&gt;take&lt;/em&gt;. Its logic is very
simple, and there are just a few lines of code inside it. It encapsulates
a collection of &amp;quot;forks&amp;quot;, which are instances of the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.takes.org/apidocs-0.9/org/takes/facets/fork/Fork.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Fork&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; interface:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Fork&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Iterator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;route&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Request&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IOException&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its only &lt;code&gt;route()&lt;/code&gt; method either returns an empty iterator or an iterator
with a single &lt;code&gt;Response&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;TkFork&lt;/code&gt; goes through all forks, calling their
&lt;code&gt;route()&lt;/code&gt; methods until one of them returns a response. Once that happens,
&lt;code&gt;TkFork&lt;/code&gt; returns this response to the caller, which is
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.takes.org/apidocs-0.9/org/takes/http/FtBasic.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;FtBasic&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s create a simple fork ourselves now. For example, we want to show
the status of the application when the &lt;code&gt;/status&lt;/code&gt; URL is requested. Here is
the code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;TkApp&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;TkWrap&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Take&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;make&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;TkFork&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Fork&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Override&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Iterator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;route&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Request&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Collection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;responses&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ArrayList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;RqHref&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;equals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;/status&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;responses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;TkStatus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;responses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;iterator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe the logic here is clear. We either return an empty iterator
or an iterator with an instance of &lt;code&gt;TkStatus&lt;/code&gt; inside. If an empty
iterator is returned, &lt;code&gt;TkFork&lt;/code&gt; will try to find another fork in the
collection that actually gets an instance of &lt;code&gt;Response&lt;/code&gt;.
By the way, if nothing is found and all forks return empty iterators,
&lt;code&gt;TkFork&lt;/code&gt; will throw a &amp;quot;Page not found&amp;quot; exception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exact logic is implemented by an out-of-the-box fork called &lt;code&gt;FkRegex&lt;/code&gt;,
which attempts to match a request URI path with the regular expression
provided:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;TkApp&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;TkWrap&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Take&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;make&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;TkFork&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;FkRegex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;/status&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;TkStatus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can compose a multi-level structure of &lt;code&gt;TkFork&lt;/code&gt; classes; for example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;TkApp&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;TsWrap&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Take&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;make&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;TkFork&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;FkRegex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;/status&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;TkFork&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;FkParams&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;f&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;json&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;TkStatusJSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()),&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;FkParams&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;f&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;xml&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;TkStatusXML&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, I believe it&amp;#39;s obvious. The instance of &lt;code&gt;FkRegex&lt;/code&gt; will ask an
encapsulated instance of &lt;code&gt;TkFork&lt;/code&gt; to return a response, and it will try to
fetch it from one that &lt;code&gt;FkParams&lt;/code&gt; encapsulated. If the HTTP query is
&lt;code&gt;/status?f=xml&lt;/code&gt;, an instance of &lt;code&gt;TkStatusXML&lt;/code&gt; will be returned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;http-response&quot;&gt;HTTP Response&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;#39;s discuss the structure of the HTTP response and its object-oriented
abstraction, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.takes.org/apidocs-0.9/org/takes/Response.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Response&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
This is how the interface looks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Iterable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IOException&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;InputStream&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IOException&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks very similar to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.takes.org/apidocs-0.9/org/takes/Request.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Request&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
doesn&amp;#39;t it? Well, it&amp;#39;s identical, mostly because the structure of the HTTP request and
response is almost identical. The only difference is the first line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a collection of useful decorators that help in response building. They
are &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/02/26/composable-decorators.html&quot;&gt;composable&lt;/a&gt;,
which makes them very convenient. For example, if you want to build a response
that contains an HTML page, you compose them like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;TkIndex&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Take&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Override&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;act&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;RsWithStatus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;RsWithType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;RsWithBody&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;Hello, world!&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;text/html&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example, the decorator &lt;code&gt;RsWithBody&lt;/code&gt;
creates a response with a body but with no headers at all. Then,
&lt;code&gt;RsWithType&lt;/code&gt; adds the header &lt;code&gt;Content-Type: text/html&lt;/code&gt; to it. Then, &lt;code&gt;RsWithStatus&lt;/code&gt;
makes sure the first line of the response contains &lt;code&gt;HTTP/1.1 200 OK&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can create your own decorators that can reuse existing ones. Take a look
at how it&amp;#39;s done in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256/rultor/blob/1.50.2/src/main/java/com/rultor/web/RsPage.java&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;RsPage&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
from rultor.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-about-templates?&quot;&gt;How About Templates?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returning simple &amp;quot;Hello, world&amp;quot; pages is not a big problem, as we can see. But
what about more complex output like HTML pages, XML documents, JSON
data sets, etc? There are a few convenient &lt;code&gt;Response&lt;/code&gt; decorators that
enable all of that. Let&amp;#39;s start with &lt;a href=&quot;http://velocity.apache.org&quot;&gt;Velocity&lt;/a&gt;,
a simple templating engine. Well, it&amp;#39;s not that simple. It&amp;#39;s rather powerful,
but I would suggest to use it in simple situations only. Here is how it
works:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;TkIndex&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Take&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Override&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;act&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;RsVelocity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Hello, ${name}&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Jeffrey&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.takes.org/apidocs-0.9/org/takes/rs/RsVelocity.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;RsVelocity&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; constructor
accepts a single argument that has to be a Velocity template. Then, you call
the &lt;code&gt;with()&lt;/code&gt; method, injecting data into the Velocity context. When it&amp;#39;s time
to render the HTTP response, &lt;code&gt;RsVelocity&lt;/code&gt; will &amp;quot;evaluate&amp;quot; the template
against the context configured. Again, I would recommend you use
this templating approach only for simple outputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more complex HTML documents, I would recommend you use XML/XSLT
in combination with Xembly. I explained this idea in a few previous posts:
&lt;a href=&quot;/2014/06/25/xml-and-xslt-in-browser.html&quot;&gt;XML+XSLT in a Browser&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/09/09/restful-web-sites.html&quot;&gt;RESTful API and a Web Site in the Same URL&lt;/a&gt;.
It is simple and powerful &amp;mdash; Java generates XML output and the XSLT
processor transforms it into HTML documents. This is how we separate
representation from data. The XSL stylesheet is a &amp;quot;view&amp;quot; and &lt;code&gt;TkIndex&lt;/code&gt; is a &amp;quot;controller&amp;quot;,
in terms of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller&quot;&gt;MVC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll write a separate article about templating with Xembly and XSL very soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, we&amp;#39;ll create decorators for &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facelets&quot;&gt;JSF/Facelets&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaServer_Pages&quot;&gt;JSP&lt;/a&gt; rendering
in Takes. If you&amp;#39;re interested in helping, please fork the framework
and submit your pull requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-about-persistence?&quot;&gt;What About Persistence?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, a question that comes up is what to do with persistent entities, like databases,
in-memory structures, network connections, etc. My suggestion is to
initialize them inside the &lt;code&gt;Entry&lt;/code&gt; class and pass them as arguments into
the &lt;code&gt;TkApp&lt;/code&gt; constructor. Then, the &lt;code&gt;TkApp&lt;/code&gt; will pass them into the
constructors of custom &lt;em&gt;takes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, we have a PostgreSQL database that contains
some table data that we need to render. Here is how I would
initialize a connection to it in the &lt;code&gt;Entry&lt;/code&gt; class (I&amp;#39;m using
a &lt;a href=&quot;http://jolbox.com/&quot;&gt;BoneCP&lt;/a&gt; connection pool):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Entry&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;FtCLI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;TkApp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Entry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;postgres&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Exit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;NEVER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;postgres&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;BoneCPDataSource&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;BoneCPDataSource&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;setDriverClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;org.postgresql.Driver&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;setJdbcUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;jdbc:postgresql://localhost/db&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;setUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;root&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;setPassword&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;super-secret-password&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the constructor of &lt;code&gt;TkApp&lt;/code&gt; must accept a single argument of type
&lt;code&gt;java.sql.Source&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;TkApp&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;TkWrap&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;TkApp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;TkApp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;make&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Take&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;make&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;TkFork&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;FkRegex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;/&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;TkIndex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Class &lt;code&gt;TkIndex&lt;/code&gt; also accepts a single argument of class &lt;code&gt;Source&lt;/code&gt;. I believe
you know what to do with it inside &lt;code&gt;TkIndex&lt;/code&gt; in order to fetch the SQL
table data and convert it into HTML. The point here is that the dependency
must be injected into the application (instance of class &lt;code&gt;TkApp&lt;/code&gt;) at the
moment of its instantiation. This is a pure and clean dependency injection
mechanism, which is absolutely container-free. Read more about it in
&lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/03/di-containers-are-evil.html&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Dependency Injection Containers Are Code Polluters&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;unit-testing&quot;&gt;Unit Testing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since every class is immutable and all dependencies are injected only
through constructors, unit testing is extremely easy. Let&amp;#39;s say we want
to test &lt;code&gt;TkStatus&lt;/code&gt;, which is supposed to return an HTML response
(I&amp;#39;m using &lt;a href=&quot;http://junit.org/&quot;&gt;JUnit 4&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hamcrest.org/&quot;&gt;Hamcrest&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;org.junit.Test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;org.hamcrest.Matchers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;TkIndexTest&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Test&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;returnsHtmlPage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;MatcherAssert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;assertThat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;RsPrint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;TkStatus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;act&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;RqFake&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;printBody&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Matchers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;equalsTo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;Hello, world!&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, we can start the entire application or any individual &lt;em&gt;take&lt;/em&gt; in a
test HTTP server and test its behavior via a real TCP socket; for example
(I&amp;#39;m using &lt;a href=&quot;http://http.jcabi.com&quot;&gt;jcabi-http&lt;/a&gt; to make an HTTP request and check the output):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;TkIndexTest&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Test&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;returnsHtmlPage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;FtRemote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;TkIndex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;exec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;FtRemote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;Script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Override&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;exec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;URI&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IOException&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;JdkRequest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;fetch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;RestResponse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;assertStatus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;HttpURLConnection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;HTTP_OK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;assertBody&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Matchers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;containsString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Hello, world!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.takes.org/apidocs-0.9/org/takes/http/FtRemote.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;FtRemote&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
starts a test web server at a random TCP port and calls the
&lt;code&gt;exec()&lt;/code&gt; method at the provided instance of &lt;code&gt;FtRemote.Script&lt;/code&gt;. The first
argument of this method is a URI of the just-started web server homepage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The architecture of Takes framework is very modular and composable. Any
individual &lt;em&gt;take&lt;/em&gt; can be tested as a standalone component, absolutely
independent from the framework and other &lt;em&gt;takes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-the-name?&quot;&gt;Why the Name?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the question I&amp;#39;ve been hearing rather often. The idea is simple, and it
originates from the movie business. When a movie is made, the crew shoots many &lt;em&gt;takes&lt;/em&gt; in order
to capture the reality and put it on film. Each capture is called a &lt;em&gt;take&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, a &lt;em&gt;take&lt;/em&gt; is like a snapshot of the reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same applies to this framework. Each instance of &lt;code&gt;Take&lt;/code&gt; represents
a reality at one particular moment in time. This reality is then sent to the
user in the form of a &lt;code&gt;Response&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Worst Technical Specifications Have No Glossaries</title>
      <link>http://www.yegor256.com/2015/03/16/technical-glossaries.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I read a few technical specifications every week from our current
and potential clients, and there&amp;#39;s one thing I can&amp;#39;t take anymore;
I have to write about it: 99 percent of the documents I&amp;#39;m reading don&amp;#39;t
have glossaries, and because of that, they are very difficult to read
and digest. Even when they do have glossaries, their definitions
of terms are very vague and ambiguous. Why is this happening? Don&amp;#39;t we
understand the importance of a common vocabulary for any software project?
I&amp;#39;m not sure what the causes are, but this is what a software
architect should do when he or she starts a project &amp;mdash; create
a glossary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='http://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/03/pulp-fiction.jpg' style='width:600px;' alt='Pulp Fiction (1994) by Quentin Tarantino'/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Pulp Fiction (1994) by Quentin Tarantino&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m trying to write something unique about this subject, but
everything I can say is so obvious that I doubt anyone
would be interested in reading it. Anyway, I will try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A glossary (a.k.a. vocabulary) is a list of terms used by the project
that is usually included at the beginning of the technical specification document.
Ideally, every technical term used in the document should be
briefly explained in the glossary. The existence of a glossary helps
everyone who works with the document quickly understand each other
and avoid misconceptions. On top of this, a detailed and accurate glossary
saves a reader a lot of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why are glossaries not written? I see a few possible causes
(usually, they are combined):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We&amp;#39;re Smarter Than This&lt;/strong&gt;.
Some people think glossaries are for newbies. After all, why would I
explain what a PDU is? Any serious network engineer should
understand that it stands for &amp;quot;protocol data unit&amp;quot;. If you don&amp;#39;t understand it,
do your homework and then come back to work with us. Our team only works
with well-educated engineers. You&amp;#39;re supposed to understand what PDU,
ADC, TxR, IPv6, DPI, FIFO, and USSR (joking!) stand for. Otherwise,
you&amp;#39;re not talented enough to be with us. Needless to say, this
attitude can only come from those who have no idea what they are doing.
A good engineer always remembers that if the receiver doesn&amp;#39;t understand
a message, it&amp;#39;s the sender&amp;#39;s fault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We Don&amp;#39;t Need These Formalities&lt;/strong&gt;.
Seriously, why would we spend time on writing a glossary if everybody
understands all our terms without it? We&amp;#39;ve been working as a team for a few
years, so we all know what DPI and FIFO are, and we know what &amp;quot;record&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;timing data&amp;quot; are. Why bother with the glossary, which will provide no
additional business value for us? I&amp;#39;ve seen many technical meetings of very
mature and &amp;quot;well-organized&amp;quot; teams burn hours of time on pointless discussions
simply because of different understandings the same term.
A glossary is not a formality; it&amp;#39;s a key instrument of a software architect
and all other team members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We Prefer Working Software Over Comprehensive Documentation&lt;/strong&gt;.
This is what the Agile Manifesto says, and it&amp;#39;s true. But the key word here is
&amp;quot;comprehensive&amp;quot;. We don&amp;#39;t need comprehensive documentation, but we need
a glossary. It&amp;#39;s a key element in any project, and it simply can&amp;#39;t
be replaced by working software. No working software can help us
understand what &amp;quot;header&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;data signal&amp;quot; are unless there
is a simple and clear statement about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We Don&amp;#39;t Have Time&lt;/strong&gt;.
We&amp;#39;re developing too fast and brainstorming every day, so the concept
is frequently changing. We simply don&amp;#39;t have time to document our
thoughts. We all understand each other, and that is the beauty of being agile.
No, that is not a beauty. Instead, it is a lack of discipline
and elementary management skill.
A lack of a glossary is a personal fault of the software architect, and there
are no excuses for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All Our Terms Are Well-Known to Everyone&lt;/strong&gt;.
Seriously, do we need to document what TCP/IP and FIFO are? That&amp;#39;s
what they teach us in school. Everyone understands that, don&amp;#39;t they? Yes,
some of the terms are well-known. But what is the problem of adding them
to the glossary with a few words and a link to a Wikipedia article? This
will only take a few minutes of an architect&amp;#39;s time, but it will make life easier
for everybody in the project, both now and in a few years from now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To conclude, there is no excuse for the absence of a glossary in any
software project. And it is the personal responsibility of a software
architect to keep this document (or a chapter) up to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope I wasn&amp;#39;t too obvious above :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Don't Create Objects That End With -ER</title>
      <link>http://www.yegor256.com/2015/03/09/objects-end-with-er.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Manager. Controller. Helper. Handler. Writer. Reader. Converter. Validator.
Router. Dispatcher. Observer. Listener. Sorter. Encoder. Decoder.
This is the class names &lt;strong&gt;hall of shame&lt;/strong&gt;. Have you seen them in your code?
In open source libraries you&amp;#39;re using? In pattern books? They are all wrong.
What do they have in common? They all end in &amp;quot;-er&amp;quot;. And what&amp;#39;s wrong with that?
They are not classes, and the objects they instantiate are not objects.
Instead, they are collections of procedures pretending to be classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='http://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/03/fight-club.jpg' style='width:600px;' alt='Fight Club (1999) by David Fincher'/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Fight Club (1999) by David Fincher&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Coad&quot;&gt;Peter Coad&lt;/a&gt;
used to say: Challenge any class name that ends in &amp;quot;-er&amp;quot;. There
are a few good articles about this subject, including
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.carlopescio.com/2011/04/your-coding-conventions-are-hurting-you.html&quot;&gt;Your Coding Conventions Are Hurting You&lt;/a&gt;
by Carlo Pescio,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://objology.blogspot.com/2011/09/one-of-best-bits-of-programming-advice.html&quot;&gt;One of the Best Bits of Programming Advice I Ever Got&lt;/a&gt;
by Travis Griggs,
and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.benhallbenhall.com/2013/01/naming-objects-er-object-names/&quot;&gt;Naming Objects – Don’t Use ER in Your Object Names&lt;/a&gt;
by Ben Hall.
The main argument against this &amp;quot;-er&amp;quot; suffix is that &amp;quot;when you need a manager,
it&amp;#39;s often a sign that the managed are just plain old data structures
and that the manager is the smart procedure doing the real work&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I totally agree but would like to add a few words to this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mentioned already in &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/11/20/seven-virtues-of-good-object.html&quot;&gt;Seven Virtues of a Good Object&lt;/a&gt;
that a good object name is not a job title, but I didn&amp;#39;t explain why I think so.
Besides that, in &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/02/20/utility-classes-vs-functional-programming.html&quot;&gt;Utility Classes Have Nothing to Do With Functional Programming&lt;/a&gt;,
I tried to explain the difference between
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming&quot;&gt;declarative&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming&quot;&gt;imperative&lt;/a&gt; programming paradigms.
Now it&amp;#39;s time to put these two pieces together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s say I&amp;#39;m an object and you&amp;#39;re my client. You give me a bucket of apples
and ask me to sort them by size. If I&amp;#39;m living in the world of imperative programming,
you will get them sorted immediately, and we will never interact again.
I will do my job just as requested, without even thinking &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; you need
them sorted. I would be a sorter who doesn&amp;#39;t really care about your real intention:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sorted&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Sorter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;sort&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;apples&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;biggest&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sorted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you see here, the real intention is to find the biggest apple in the bucket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not what you would expect from a good business partner
who can help you work with a bucket of apples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, if I lived in the world of declarative programming, I would
tell you: &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Consider them sorted; what do you want to do next?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;. You, in turn,
would tell me that you need the biggest apple now. And I would say,
&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;No problem; here it is&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;. In order to return the biggest one, I would not
sort them all. I would just go through them all one by one and select the
biggest. This operation is much faster than sorting first and then selecting
the first in the list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, I would silently &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; follow your instructions but would
try to do my business my way. I would be a much smarter partner of yours
than that imperative sorter. And I would become a real object that behaves
like a sorted list of apples instead of a procedure that sorts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sorted&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Sorted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;apples&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;biggest&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sorted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See the difference?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pay special attention to the difference between the &lt;code&gt;sorter&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sorted&lt;/code&gt; names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s get back to class names. When you add the &amp;quot;-er&amp;quot; suffix to your class name,
you&amp;#39;re immediately turning it into a dumb imperative executor of &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; will.
You do not allow it to think and improvise. You expect it to do exactly
what you want &amp;mdash; sort, manage, control, print, write, combine, concatenate, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An object is a &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/11/20/seven-virtues-of-good-object.html&quot;&gt;living organism&lt;/a&gt;
that doesn&amp;#39;t want to be told what to do. It wants to be an equal partner with
other objects, exposing behavior according to its contract(s), a.k.a.
interfaces in Java and C# or protocols in Swift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Philosophically speaking, the &amp;quot;-er&amp;quot; suffix is a sign of disrespect toward the poor object.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Team Morale: Myths and Reality</title>
      <link>http://www.yegor256.com/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of books, articles, and blog posts about &lt;em&gt;team morale&lt;/em&gt;. They
will all suggest you do things like regular celebrations, team events,
free lunches, pet-friendly offices, coffee machines, birthday presents, etc.
All of these are instruments of &lt;strong&gt;concealed enslaving&lt;/strong&gt;.
These traditional techniques turn employees into
speechless monkeys, programming under the influence of Prozac. Their existence
and popularity is our big misfortune. Let me present my own
vision of how team morale can be boosted on a software team &amp;mdash; a team that
has a strong leader and a good project manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='http://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/03/apocalypto.jpg' style='width:600px;' alt='Apocalypto (2006) by Mel Gibson'/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Apocalypto (2006) by Mel Gibson&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fire Fast&lt;/strong&gt;.
The first and most important quality of a good leader is his or her
ability to separate bad apples from good ones as soon as possible.
Nothing will earn you more disrespect from your team than tolerance of
underperforming team members. Your job as a leader is to help the best players
play better, and they can&amp;#39;t play better if they see that management
doesn&amp;#39;t understand the difference between excellence and mediocrity. It&amp;#39;s
a severe demotivating factor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be Honest About Problems and Risks&lt;/strong&gt;.
Your team is following you and expecting you to be a smart leader. While they
are writing Java, you&amp;#39;re talking to investors and customers. They want to
be sure you know what you&amp;#39;re doing. The best way to show them
you have no idea where the team is going is to tell them that the future
is bright and cloudless. Everybody understands that&amp;#39;s either a lie and you
are trying to hide risks or you&amp;#39;re stupid enough to not see them. In either
case, the best people would attempt to quit before it&amp;#39;s too late. Thus, to keep
morale up, regularly inform your people about problems you&amp;#39;re facing and
risks you&amp;#39;re trying to prevent. They will appreciate it and respect you.
A strong, professional manager deals with risks instead of ignoring them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Failures Are Yours; Success Is Theirs&lt;/strong&gt;.
Always remember that when someone on your team makes a mistake,
it is first of all &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; personal mistake. You hired that person,
you trained him or her, you delegated the responsibility, and you
controlled and monitored the job. Then he made a mistake, and the project
lost money, disappointed a customer, or damaged the firm&amp;#39;s reputation. Of course you need to
take necessary disciplinary actions and maybe fire the troublemaker. But first of all,
you have to admit in front of everyone that it was your personal mistake.
You didn&amp;#39;t control enough, you didn&amp;#39;t plan well, or you didn&amp;#39;t take preventive actions.
This is what the team expects from you. Also, your people expect
you to explain to them how you&amp;#39;re going to learn from this mistake in order to prevent
a similar one from happening in the future. A strong leader isn&amp;#39;t afraid to look
stupid in front of the team. A weak leader does look stupid when he or she
tries to hide mistakes that have been made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibility Is Always Personal&lt;/strong&gt;.
The most demotivating word used in task descriptions is &amp;quot;together&amp;quot;. Don&amp;#39;t use it.
Each task has to be personally and individually assigned (no matter what the Agile Manifesto says).
Everybody is responsible for his or her own success or failure. How their results
join together and lead to a mutual success or failure &amp;mdash; that&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; business.
Whether you succeed or fail, we all will see. Once you say we all have to succeed together,
the team understands that you&amp;#39;re trying to shift responsibility from your own
shoulders to theirs. It&amp;#39;s a sign of weakness, and you lose respect. Make
tasks and goals strictly personal, and be prepared to be responsible for
the group&amp;#39;s success. You, as a manager, break down an entire project into
parts and delegate them to your people. If you do this job properly,
we all will succeed. But don&amp;#39;t try to blame us if the parts fall apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;#39;t Mention Steve Jobs&lt;/strong&gt;.
Try to avoid global slogans and world domination speeches in the office and
in front of the team. They demotivate. If we&amp;#39;re doing so good, why are
our salaries not reflecting this success yet? If your vision is so global,
why is it not yet implemented in reality? Don&amp;#39;t promise to become the next Steve Jobs.
Instead, become the next good manager of a highly paid team that is solving
interesting problems for real people. Your practical achievements, no matter
how small and down-to-earth they are, will give you much more respect than
many-hour-long speeches about our fantastic future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;#39;t Say a Word About Agile&lt;/strong&gt;.
Even though Agile is a great attitude-changing and mind-shifting concept,
it is absolutely inapplicable in practice, mostly because it is too
abstract. When you&amp;#39;re proclaiming in the office that we should value
&amp;quot;working software over comprehensive documentation&amp;quot;, it sounds like
you don&amp;#39;t know what you&amp;#39;re doing. The team doesn&amp;#39;t need such abstract
slogans from you. It needs specific instructions and rules in order
to follow them and produce results, money, and satisfaction. Agile is a set
of abstract principles that you should understand and digest. But then,
after you chew them properly, convert them to specific and
very unambitious rules of work. Don&amp;#39;t talk about Agile; be agile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;#39;t Close the Door&lt;/strong&gt;.
Responsibility is personal, money is personal, and results are personal. But
their discussions should be open to everybody. Don&amp;#39;t close the door to that
meeting room when you&amp;#39;re talking about problems or appraising someone&amp;#39;s
results. You want your team to work together? Give everybody an assurance
that none of them will be terminated behind a closed door. These pompous
speeches about &amp;quot;us working together&amp;quot; usually turn into mush once the team
sees that someone gets fired after a private conversation with a manager.
Are we together, or is it you against us? To keep team morale up, you, as a leader,
have to establish ground rules of work that will define who gets what
when we succeed and who goes home first when we fail. These rules should
be open to everybody. These rules should rule the team, not your personal
decisions made behind a closed door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Celebrate Achievements Instead of Birthdays&lt;/strong&gt;.
Team-building events are a great tool to boost team morale, but only when
they are built around personal or team achievements instead of calendar events.
A project team is not a group of friends or family members, even though
some teams may feel like that. No matter how it feels, a team is here
for one reason &amp;mdash; to create the product and make money for its sponsor.
This is the direction we&amp;#39;re going. Our goal is not to build a community and
live together til the end of our days. Our goal is to achieve the business
success of the product we&amp;#39;re developing, or in other words, complete the project.
When the only events we&amp;#39;re celebrating are our birthdays, that&amp;#39;s a sign to
us that our leaders are trying to lie to us. They are pretending that we&amp;#39;re
here to make a community of friends while in reality they are using us to
build their business. It&amp;#39;s unhealthy and ruins team morale. Instead, celebrate
achievements on your real path &amp;mdash; to the success of the product under
development. This will show everybody that you, as a leader, are honest with
your people and ready to show them that their true role on the team is
to develop a product and earn money for its investors. Honesty is the best
team morale booster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;#39;t Rule; Make Rules and Plans&lt;/strong&gt;.
Nothing demotivates more than an upredictable manager. For the team, you are
an abstraction of the entire world around the team. They see
the reality through the prism of your personality. What you tell them about
the reality is what they perceive. If you are unpredictable, the reality
is unpredictable and scary for them. To avoid that, stop making decisions that
are based on your personal and momentary judgement.
Instead, make decisions that are based on the rules you&amp;#39;ve defined upfront
and plans you&amp;#39;ve drawn beforehand. First, create a plan for team
growth and announce it to everybody. The plan should include risks and
their mitigations. The plan should say who will be fired
first when or if the project goes down. The plan should give a predictable
and measurable picture of the reality around your office. It should be a map
of terrain you&amp;#39;re going to cross with your team. When it&amp;#39;s time to make
a decision, everybody will understand why it&amp;#39;s made and will respect you
as a leader who predicted the situation and managed it professionally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Put Money on the Table&lt;/strong&gt;.
Discuss money openly and freely, right in the office, right in front
of everybody. This advice is for true professionals. If you can&amp;#39;t do what
is said above, don&amp;#39;t try this one. But if you consider yourself a real
pro in management and leadership, you should put money on the table and
let everybody know who is getting what, when, why, and why not. Everybody
should know everybody&amp;#39;s salaries, bonuses, benefits, and the rationale behind them.
Each programmer should know what he or she should do in order to get
a $5,000 raise to their annual salary. Also, he or she should know why a
colleague is called &amp;quot;senior developer&amp;quot; while his or her title is still &amp;quot;junior&amp;quot;.
This information should be public and printed on the wall right behind
your chair. Why don&amp;#39;t most managers do this? Because they don&amp;#39;t have any
rationale behind their monetary decisions. Instead of managing the money,
they let money manage them. That&amp;#39;s a subject for another post :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Composable Decorators vs. Imperative Utility Methods</title>
      <link>http://www.yegor256.com/2015/02/26/composable-decorators.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern&quot;&gt;decorator pattern&lt;/a&gt;
is my favorite among all other patterns I&amp;#39;m aware of. It is a very simple
and yet very powerful mechanism to make your code
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohesion_%28computer_science%29&quot;&gt;highly cohesive&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_%28computer_programming%29&quot;&gt;loosely coupled&lt;/a&gt;.
However, I believe decorators are not used often enough. They should
be everywhere, but they are not. The biggest advantage we get from decorators
is that they make our code &lt;em&gt;composable&lt;/em&gt;. That&amp;#39;s why the title of this
post is composable decorators. Unfortunately, instead of decorators, we often use imperative
utility methods, which make our code procedural rather than object-oriented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe class=&quot;video&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/D0dqC_3Bch8&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='http://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/02/russina-matroshka.jpg' style='width:600px;' alt='Матрёшка'/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Матрёшка&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, a practical example. Here is an interface for an object that is
supposed to read a text somewhere and return it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;read&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an implementation that reads the text from a file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;TextInFile&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;File&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;TextInFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;File&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Override&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;read&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Files&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;readAllBytes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;UTF-8&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now the decorator, which is another implementation of &lt;code&gt;Text&lt;/code&gt; that
removes all unprintable characters from the text:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;PrintableText&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;origin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;PrintableText&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;origin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Override&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;read&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;origin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;read&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;replaceAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;[^\p{Print}]&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is how I&amp;#39;m using it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;PrintableText&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;TextInFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;File&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;/tmp/a.txt&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;content&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;read&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the &lt;code&gt;PrintableText&lt;/code&gt; doesn&amp;#39;t read the text from the file. It doesn&amp;#39;t
really care where the text is coming from. It &lt;em&gt;delegates&lt;/em&gt; text reading to
the encapsulated instance of &lt;code&gt;Text&lt;/code&gt;. How this encapsulated object will
deal with the text and where it will get it doesn&amp;#39;t concern &lt;code&gt;PrintableText&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s continue and try to create an implemetation of &lt;code&gt;Text&lt;/code&gt;
that will capitalize all letters in the text:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;AllCapsText&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;origin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;AllCapsText&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;origin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Override&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;read&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;origin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;read&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;toUpperCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Locale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ENGLISH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about a &lt;code&gt;Text&lt;/code&gt; that trims the input:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;TrimmedText&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;origin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;TrimmedText&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;origin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Override&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;read&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;origin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;read&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;trim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can go on and on with these decorators. I can create many of them,
suitable for their own individual use cases. But let&amp;#39;s see how they all
can play together. Let&amp;#39;s say I want to read the text from the file,
capitalize it, trim it, and remove all unprintable characters. And I want
to be &lt;em&gt;declarative&lt;/em&gt;. Here is what I do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;AllCapsText&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;TrimmedText&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;PrintableText&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;TextInFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;File&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;/tmp/a.txt&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;content&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;read&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I create an instance of &lt;code&gt;Text&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;em&gt;composing&lt;/em&gt; multiple decorators into
a single object. I declaratively define the behavior of &lt;code&gt;text&lt;/code&gt; without
actually executing anything. Until method &lt;code&gt;read()&lt;/code&gt; is called, the file is not touched
and the processing of the text is not started. The object &lt;code&gt;text&lt;/code&gt; is just
a composition of decorators, not an executable &lt;em&gt;procedure&lt;/em&gt;. Check out this
article about declarative and imperative styles of programming:
&lt;a href=&quot;/2015/02/20/utility-classes-vs-functional-programming.html&quot;&gt;Utility Classes Have Nothing to Do With Functional Programming&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This design is much more flexible and reusable than a more traditional one,
where the &lt;code&gt;Text&lt;/code&gt; object is smart enough to perform all said operations. For
example, class &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
from Java is a good example of a bad design. It has
more than 20 &lt;em&gt;utility methods&lt;/em&gt; that should have been provided as decorators instead: &lt;code&gt;trim()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;toUpperCase()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;substring()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;split()&lt;/code&gt;, and many others, for example.
When I want to trim my string, uppercase it, and then split it into pieces,
here is what my code will look like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;txt&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;hello, world!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;parts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;txt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;trim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;toUpperCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot; &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is imperative and procedural programming. Composable decorators,
on the other hand, would make this code object-oriented and declarative. Something
like this would be great to have in Java instead (pseudo-code):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;parts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;Split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;UpperCased&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;Trimmed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;hello, world!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To conclude, I recommend you think twice every time you add
a new utility method to the interface/class. Try to avoid utility methods as much
as possible, and use decorators instead. An ideal interface should contain
only methods that you absolutely cannot remove. Everything else should be
done through composable decorators.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Haircut</title>
      <link>http://www.yegor256.com/2015/02/23/haircut.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I received a haircut today, and the niceness of my hairdresser led him to fill the
appointment with courteous questions about how I wanted my hair cut, what size of clipper
he should use, how long the sides should be, and how much should be removed
from the front. He also offered me many types of shampoo and a cup of tea.
All this reminded me of the work we do as programmers, and I
decided to write a short post about it. I&amp;#39;ve already
&lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/26/happy-boss-false-objective.html&quot;&gt;mentioned before&lt;/a&gt;
that trying to make a customer happy is a false objective. This hairdresser
was a perfect illustrative example of this very mistake. By the way, in the end,
I wasn&amp;#39;t happy, and he got no tip. How could this happen if he was so
friendly and nice?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='http://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/02/the-man-who-wasnt-there.jpg' style='width:600px;' alt='The Man Who Wasn&amp;amp;apos;t There (2001) by Coen Brothers'/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Man Who Wasn't There (2001) by Coen Brothers&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not a hairdresser, and I have very little understanding of how to deal
with hair. I came to him because I assumed he knew more about this
business than I did. I chose him through the assistance of Yelp. I wanted &lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt; to tell me
how long the hair on the sides should be and how much should be removed on the
top. I expected &lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt; to give me his professional judgement and stand by it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of asking me how much I wanted removed on the sides, he should have
told me there should be less on the sides. This is what
a true professional would do. A true professional would give me &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; vision
of the haircut that best suits me and would try to convince me that
it was the best choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A true professional would not ask me but would &lt;em&gt;tell&lt;/em&gt; me instead, because
he would understand that my goal was not to boss him around and make him do my
hair the way I wanted it. My goal was to get the best out
of his professional skill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the guy was either weak or immature. He didn&amp;#39;t argue with me
and didn&amp;#39;t try to convince me. He tried to &lt;em&gt;please&lt;/em&gt; me. In the end, he
lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exactly the same thing happens when we ask our customers about
the technologies they want us to use. I hear this question very often:
&lt;em&gt;What language do you want us to use&lt;/em&gt; (meaning Java or Ruby or something else)?
Or &lt;em&gt;what database should we use?&lt;/em&gt; Or &lt;em&gt;how do you want us to design this?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t do that. Don&amp;#39;t lose like that hairdresser. Don&amp;#39;t ask your clients
what they want. Instead, &lt;em&gt;learn&lt;/em&gt; their business requirements and then
&lt;em&gt;suggest&lt;/em&gt; the solution you think is the best for them. Then, insist and argue
if they don&amp;#39;t agree. Convince them. Even if they fire you in the end for
your stubbornness, it&amp;#39;s better than being that hairdresser who is doomed
to please every single client without getting anywhere further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, the client is not the king; his hairs are.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Utility Classes Have Nothing to Do With Functional Programming</title>
      <link>http://www.yegor256.com/2015/02/20/utility-classes-vs-functional-programming.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lukaseder/status/564866432790708224&quot;&gt;accused&lt;/a&gt; of being against
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming&quot;&gt;functional programming&lt;/a&gt;
because &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/05/05/oop-alternative-to-utility-classes.html&quot;&gt;I call utility classes an anti-pattern&lt;/a&gt;.
That&amp;#39;s absolutely wrong! Well, I do consider them a terrible anti-pattern,
but they have nothing to do with functional programming. I believe there are
two basic reasons why. First, functional programming is declarative, while
utility class methods are imperative. Second,
functional programming is based on lambda calculus, where
a function can be assigned to a variable. Utility class methods
are not functions in this sense. I&amp;#39;ll decode these statements in a minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Java, there are basically two valid alternatives to these ugly utility
classes aggressively promoted by &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/&quot;&gt;Guava&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://commons.apache.org/&quot;&gt;Apache Commons&lt;/a&gt;, and others. The first one
is the use of traditional classes, and the second one is &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/lambdaexpressions.html&quot;&gt;Java 8 lambda&lt;/a&gt;.
Now let&amp;#39;s see why utility classes are not even close to functional programming
and where this misconception is coming from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='http://www.yegor256.com/images/2015/02/color-me-kubrick.png' style='width:600px;' alt='Color Me Kubrick (2005) by Brian W. Cook'/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Color Me Kubrick (2005) by Brian W. Cook&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a typical example of a utility class
&lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Math&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from Java 1.0:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;double&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;abs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;double&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// a few dozens of other methods of the same style&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is how you would use it when you want to calculate an absolute
value of a floating point number:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;double&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;abs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;3.1415926d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s wrong with it? We need a function, and we get it from class &lt;code&gt;Math&lt;/code&gt;.
The class has many useful functions inside it that can be used for many typical
mathematical operations, like calculating maximum, minimum, sine, cosine, etc.
It is a very popular concept; just look at any commercial or open source product.
These utility classes are used everywhere since Java was invented (this
&lt;code&gt;Math&lt;/code&gt; class was introduced in Java&amp;#39;s first version). Well, technically
there is nothing wrong. The code will work. But it is not object-oriented
programming. Instead, it is imperative and procedural. Do we care? Well,
it&amp;#39;s up to you to decide. Let&amp;#39;s see what the difference is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are basically two different approaches: declarative and imperative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming&quot;&gt;Imperative programming&lt;/a&gt;
is focused on describing &lt;strong&gt;how&lt;/strong&gt; a program operates
in terms of statements that change a program state. We just saw an example
of imperative programming above. Here is another (this is pure imperative/procedural
programming that has nothing to do with OOP):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;MyMath&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;double&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;double&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;double&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;double&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;max&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;max&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;double&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;abs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;max&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming&quot;&gt;Declarative programming&lt;/a&gt;
focuses on &lt;strong&gt;what&lt;/strong&gt; the program should accomplish without prescribing
how to do it in terms of sequences of actions to be taken. This is how
the same code would look in Lisp, a functional programming language:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-lisp&quot; data-lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;defun&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;abs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;max&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s the catch? Just a difference in syntax? Not really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_programming_paradigms&quot;&gt;many definitions&lt;/a&gt;
of the difference between imperative and declarative styles, but I will try to
give my own. There are basically three roles interacting in the scenario
with this &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; function/method: a &lt;em&gt;buyer&lt;/em&gt;, a &lt;em&gt;packager&lt;/em&gt; of the result,
and a &lt;em&gt;consumer&lt;/em&gt; of the result. Let&amp;#39;s say I call this function like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;double&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;calc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;max+abs equals to &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;double&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;calc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;double&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;double&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;double&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, method &lt;code&gt;calc()&lt;/code&gt; is a buyer, method &lt;code&gt;Math.f()&lt;/code&gt; is a packager of the result,
and method &lt;code&gt;foo()&lt;/code&gt; is a consumer. No matter which programming style is used,
there are always these three guys participating in the process:
the buyer, the packager, and the consumer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine you&amp;#39;re a buyer and want to purchase a gift for your (girl|boy)friend. The first
option is to visit a shop, pay $50, let them package that perfume for you,
and then deliver it to the friend (and get a kiss in return). This is an &lt;strong&gt;imperative&lt;/strong&gt; style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second option is to visit a shop, pay $50, and get a gift card. You then
present this card to the friend (and get a kiss in return). When he or she decides to convert it
to perfume, he or she will visit the shop and get it. This
is a &lt;strong&gt;declarative&lt;/strong&gt; style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See the difference?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first case, which is imperative, you force the packager (a beauty shop)
to find that perfume in stock, package it, and present it to you as
a ready-to-be-used product. In the second scenario, which is declarative,
you&amp;#39;re just getting a promise from the shop that eventually, when it&amp;#39;s
necessary, the staff will find the perfume in stock, package it, and provide it to
those who need it. If your friend never visits the shop with that gift card,
the perfume will remain in stock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, your friend can use that gift card as a product itself, never
visiting the shop. He or she may instead present it to somebody else as a gift
or just exchange it for another card or product. The gift card itself
becomes a product!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the difference is what the consumer is getting &amp;mdash; either a
product ready to be used (imperative) or a voucher for the product, which
can later be converted into a real product (declarative).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Utility classes, like &lt;code&gt;Math&lt;/code&gt; from JDK or &lt;code&gt;StringUtils&lt;/code&gt; from Apache Commons,
return products ready to be used immediately, while functions in Lisp
and other functional languages return &amp;quot;vouchers&amp;quot;. For example, if you
call the &lt;code&gt;max&lt;/code&gt; function in Lisp, the actual maximum between two numbers
will only be calculated when you actually start using it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-lisp&quot; data-lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;max&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;X equals to &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until this &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; actually starts to output characters to the
screen, the function &lt;code&gt;max&lt;/code&gt; won&amp;#39;t be called. This &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is a &amp;quot;voucher&amp;quot; returned
to you when you attempted to &amp;quot;buy&amp;quot; a maximum between &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;5&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note, however, that nesting Java static functions one into another doesn&amp;#39;t
make them declarative. The code is still imperative, because its execution
delivers the result here and now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;MyMath&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;double&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;double&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;double&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;abs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;max&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Okay,&amp;quot; you may say, &amp;quot;I got it, but why is declarative style better than imperative?
What&amp;#39;s the big deal?&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;m getting to it. Let me first show the difference
between functions in functional programming and static methods in OOP.
As mentioned above, this is the second big difference between utility
classes and functional programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any functional programming language, you can do this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-lisp&quot; data-lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;defun&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, later, you can call that &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-lisp&quot; data-lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;defun&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;bar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;defining&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;bar&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;bar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;passing&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;bar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;an&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;argument&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Static methods in Java are not &lt;em&gt;functions&lt;/em&gt; in terms of functional programming.
You can&amp;#39;t do anything like this with a static method. You can&amp;#39;t pass a static
method as an argument to another method. Basically, static
methods are procedures or, simply put, Java statements grouped under a unique
name. The only way to access them is to call a procedure and pass all
necessary arguments to it. The procedure will calculate something and return
a result that is immediately ready for usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now we&amp;#39;re getting to the final question I can hear you asking:
&amp;quot;Okay, utility classes are not functional programming, but they look like
functional programming, they work very fast, and they are very easy to
use. Why not use them? Why aim for perfection when 20 years of Java history
proves that utility classes are the main instrument of each Java developer?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides OOP fundamentalism, which I&amp;#39;m very often accused of, there are
a few very practical reasons (BTW, I am an OOP fundamentalist):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testability&lt;/strong&gt;.
Calls to static methods in utility classes are hard-coded dependencies that
can never be broken for testing purposes. If your class is calling
&lt;code&gt;FileUtils.readFile()&lt;/code&gt;, I will never be able to test it without using
a real file on disk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Efficiency&lt;/strong&gt;.
Utility classes, due to their imperative nature, are much less efficient
than their &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/05/05/oop-alternative-to-utility-classes.html&quot;&gt;declarative alternatives&lt;/a&gt;.
They simply do all calculations right here and now, taking processor
resources even when it&amp;#39;s not yet necessary. Instead of returning a promise
to break down a string into chunks, &lt;code&gt;StringUtils.split()&lt;/code&gt; breaks it down
right now. And it breaks it down into all possible chunks, even if only
the first one is required by the &amp;quot;buyer&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Readability&lt;/strong&gt;.
Utility classes tend to be huge (try to read the source code of &lt;code&gt;StringUtils&lt;/code&gt;
or &lt;code&gt;FileUtils&lt;/code&gt; from Apache Commons). The entire idea of separation of concerns,
which makes OOP so beautiful, is absent in utility classes. They just
put all possible procedures into one huge &lt;code&gt;.java&lt;/code&gt; file, which becomes
absolutely unmaintainable when it surpasses a dozen static methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To conclude, let me reiterate: Utility classes have nothing to do
with functional programming. They are simply bags of static methods, which
are imperative procedures. Try to stay as far as possible away from them and
use solid, cohesive objects no matter how many of them you have to declare
and how small they are.&lt;/p&gt;
