In <del>most</del> all articles <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=inheritance+is+bad">I’ve found</a> addressing this subject, authors have said that inheritance may be harmful to your code, so it’s better not to use it. This “better” part is what bothers me; does it mean that sometimes inheritance makes sense? I interviewed <a href="http://davewest.us/">David West</a> (the author of <a href="https://amzn.to/266oJr4">Object Thinking</a>, my favorite book about OOP) a few weeks ago, and he said that inheritance should not exist in object-oriented programming at all (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-hdZZzMCac">full video</a>). Maybe Dr. West is right and we should totally forget <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">extends</code> keyword in Java, for example?</p><amp-img src="/images/2016/09/death-at-a-funeral.jpg"alt="Death at a Funeral (2007) by Frank Oz"height="668"width="1200"layout="responsive"></amp-img><p>I think we should. And I think I know the reason why.<p>It’s not because we introduce unnecessary coupling, as Allen Holub said in his <a href="https://www.javaworld.com/article/2073649/core-java/why-extends-is-evil.html">Why extends is evil</a> article. He was definitely right, but I believe it’s not the root cause of the problem.<p>“Inherit,” as an English verb, has a number of meanings. <a href="https://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/inherit">This one</a> is what inheritance inventors in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simula">Simula</a> had in mind, I guess: “Derive (a quality, characteristic, or predisposition) genetically from one’s parents or ancestors.”<p>Deriving a characteristic from another object is a great idea, and it’s called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtyping">subtyping</a>. It perfectly fits into OOP and actually enables <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_%28computer_science%29">polymorphism</a>: An object of class <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Article</code> inherits all characteristics of objects in class <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Manuscript</code> and adds its own. For example, it <em>inherits</em> an ability to print itself and <em>adds</em> an ability to submit itself to a conference:<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">interface</span> <span class="nc">Manuscript</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">print</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">Console</span> <span class="n">console</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
<span class="kd">interface</span> <span class="nc">Article</span> <span class="kd">extends</span> <span class="nc">Manuscript</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">submit</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">Conference</span> <span class="n">cnf</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>This is <em>subtyping</em>, and it’s a perfect technique; whenever a manuscript is required, we can provide an article and nobody will notice anything, because type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Article</code> is a subtype of type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Manuscript</code> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle">Liskov substitution principle</a>).<p>But what does <em>copying</em> methods and attributes from a parent class to a child one have to do with “deriving characteristics?” Implementation inheritance is exactly that—copying—and it has nothing to do with the meaning of the word “inherit” I quoted above.<p>Implementation inheritance is much closer to a different <a href="https://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/inherit">meaning</a>: “Receive (money, property, or a title) as an heir at the death of the previous holder.” Who is dead, you ask? An object is dead if it allows other objects to <em>inherit</em> its encapsulated code and data. This is implementation inheritance:<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">Manuscript</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="kd">protected</span> <span class="nc">String</span> <span class="n">body</span><span class="o">;</span>
  <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">print</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">Console</span> <span class="n">console</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="n">console</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">println</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">body</span><span class="o">);</span>

</code></pre></div></div><p>Class <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Article</code> <em>copies</em> method <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">print()</code> and attribute <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">body</code> from class <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Manuscript</code>, as if it’s not a <a href="/2014/11/20/seven-virtues-of-good-object.html">living organism</a>, but rather a dead one from which we can inherit its parts, “money, properties, or a title.”<p>Implementation inheritance was created as a mechanism for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_reuse">code reuse</a>, and it doesn’t fit into OOP at all. Yes, it may look convenient in the beginning, but it is absolutely wrong in terms of <a href="https://amzn.to/266oJr4">object thinking</a>. Just like <a href="/2014/09/16/getters-and-setters-are-evil.html">getters and setters</a>, implementation inheritance turns objects into <em>containers</em> with data and procedures. Of course, it’s convenient to copy some of those data and procedures to a new object in order to avoid code duplication. But this is not what objects are about. They are not dead; they are alive!<p>Don’t <em>kill</em> them with inheritance!<p>Thus, I think inheritance is bad because it is a <em>procedural</em> technique for <em>code reuse</em>. It comes as no surprise that it introduces all the problems people have been talking about for years. Because it is procedural! That’s why it doesn’t fit into object-oriented programming.<p>By the way, we <a href="https://gitter.im/yegor256/elegantobjects?at=57bcd2e4cd00bdff6e745584">discussed</a> this problem in our <a href="https://gitter.im/yegor256/elegantobjects">Gitter chat</a> (it’s dead already) a week ago, and that’s when it became obvious to me what exactly is wrong with inheritance. Take a look at our discussion there.</article>
