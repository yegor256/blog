      <h1>Inheritance Is a Procedural Technique for Code Reuse</h1>
      <p>We all know that
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(object-oriented_programming)">inheritance</a>
is bad and that
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance">composition over inheritance</a>
is a
<a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/65179">good idea</a>,
but do we really understand why?
In <del>most</del> all articles
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=inheritance+is+bad">I've found</a>
addressing this subject, authors have said that inheritance may be harmful
to your code, so it's better not to use it. This "better" part is what bothers me;
does it mean that sometimes inheritance makes sense?
I interviewed <a href="http://davewest.us/">David West</a>
(the author of <a href="http://amzn.to/266oJr4">Object Thinking</a>, my favorite book about OOP)
a few weeks ago, and he said that inheritance should not exist in
object-oriented programming at all (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-hdZZzMCac">full video</a>).
Maybe Dr. West is right and we should totally forget <code>extends</code> keyword in Java,
for example.</p>



<amp-img src="https://cf.jare.io/?u=http://www.yegor256.com/images/2016/09/death-at-a-funeral.jpg" alt="Death at a Funeral (2007) by Frank Oz" height="668" width="1200" layout="responsive"></amp-img>

<p>I think we should. And I think I know the reason why.</p>

<p>It's not because we introduce unnecessary coupling, as Allen Holub said in his
<a href="http://www.javaworld.com/article/2073649/core-java/why-extends-is-evil.html">Why extends is evil</a> article.
He was definitely right, but I believe it's not the root cause of the problem.</p>

<p>"Inherit," as an English verb, has a number of meanings.
<a href="http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/inherit">This one</a>
is what inheritance inventors in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simula">Simula</a> had in mind, I guess:
"Derive (a quality, characteristic, or predisposition) genetically from one's parents or ancestors."</p>

<p>Deriving a characteristic from another object is a great idea, and it's called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtyping">subtyping</a>.
It perfectly fits into OOP and actually enables
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_%28computer_science%29">polymorphism</a>:
An object of class <code>Article</code> inherits all characteristics of objects in class <code>Manuscript</code>
and adds its own. For example, it <em>inherits</em> an ability to print itself
and <em>adds</em> an ability to submit itself to a conference:</p>

<pre>interface Manuscript {
  void print(Console console);
}
interface Article extends Manuscript {
  void submit(Conference cnf);
}</pre>

<p>This is <em>subtyping</em>, and it's a perfect technique; whenever a
manuscript is required, we can provide an article and nobody will
notice anything, because type <code>Article</code> is a subtype of type <code>Manuscript</code>
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle">Liskov substitution principle</a>).</p>

<p>But what does <em>copying</em> methods and attributes from a parent class to a child
one have to do with "deriving characteristics?" Implementation inheritance
is exactly that—copying—and it has nothing to do with the meaning
of the word "inherit" I quoted above.</p>

<p>Implementation inheritance is much closer to a different
<a href="http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/inherit">meaning</a>:
"Receive (money, property, or a title) as an heir at the death of the previous holder."
Who is dead, you ask? An object is dead if it allows other objects to
<em>inherit</em> its encapsulated code and data. This is implementation
inheritance:</p>

<pre>class Manuscript {
  protected String body;
  void print(Console console) {
    console.println(this.body);
  }
}
class Article extends Manuscript {
  void submit(Conference cnf) {
    cnf.send(this.body);
  }
}</pre>

<p>Class <code>Article</code> <strong>copies</strong> method <code>print()</code> and attribute <code>body</code>
from class <code>Manuscript</code>, as if it's not a
<a href="/2014/11/20/seven-virtues-of-good-object.html">living organism</a>, but rather a dead
one from which we can inherit its parts, "money, properties, or a title."</p>



<p>Implementation inheritance was created as a mechanism for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_reuse">code reuse</a>,
and it doesn't fit into OOP at all. Yes, it may look convenient in the
beginning, but it is absolutely wrong in terms of <a href="http://amzn.to/266oJr4">object thinking</a>.
Just like <a href="/2014/09/16/getters-and-setters-are-evil.html">getters and setters</a>,
implementation inheritance turns
objects into <em>containers</em> with data and procedures. Of course, it's
convenient to copy some of those data and procedures to a new object
in order to avoid code duplication. But this is not what objects are about. They
are not dead; they are alive!</p>

<p>Don't <strong>kill</strong> them with inheritance :)</p>

<p>Thus, I think inheritance is bad because it is a <em>procedural</em> technique for <em>code reuse</em>.
It comes as no surprise that it introduces all the problems people have been talking about for years.
Because it is procedural!
That's why it doesn't fit into object-oriented programming.</p>

<p>By the way, we <a href="https://gitter.im/yegor256/elegantobjects?at=57bcd2e4cd00bdff6e745584">discussed</a>
this problem in our
<a href="https://gitter.im/yegor256/elegantobjects">Gitter chat</a>
a week ago, and that's when it became obvious to me what exactly is
wrong with inheritance. Take a look at our discussion there.</p>
