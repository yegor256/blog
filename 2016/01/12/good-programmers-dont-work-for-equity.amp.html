I’m a great entrepreneur. This is a breakthrough idea. Help me build it. I don’t have cash, but I will give you equity. Deal?” I hear this at least once a month, and I always say no. Not because I don’t like your idea. Indeed, it is really interesting. And not because I’m too busy. I would definitely find time for a good idea. It’s not that. I say no because I don’t think you’re a good entrepreneur.</p><amp-img src="/images/2016/01/how-much-do-you-love-me.jpg"alt="Combien tu m'aimes? (2005) by Bertrand Blier"height="739"width="1200"layout="responsive"></amp-img><p>So you want a good programmer to build your product. Or maybe a group of good programmers. And you are ready to give me some equity in exchange. That’s reasonable.<p>But what is your part of the deal?<p>How much are you putting on the table?<p>You say that you’re a good entrepreneur, right? How come you don’t have money, then? How come you can’t find someone to pay for the work of a good programmer?<p>I will create a product for you, but you will most certainly fail. You <em>already</em> failed. You failed to find initial investment to cover the startup expenses of the business. Why do you think you will succeed after the product is ready?<p>The point is that a good programmer will <em>never</em> work for equity. Not because a good programmer is greedy, or doesn’t want to risk, or doesn’t believe in new ideas. Not at all.<p>A good programmer wants to work with a <em>good</em> entrepreneur. And a good entrepreneur knows how to find money. That’s the definition of a decent entrepreneur.<p>Period.</article>
