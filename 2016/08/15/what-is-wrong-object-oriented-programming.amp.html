Then, suddenly, the question came up: “<em>What problems?</em>” I was puzzled. I thought it was obvious that the vast majority of modern software written in modern OO languages is unmaintainable and simply a mess. So I Googled a bit, and this is what I found (in chronological order).</p><amp-img src="/images/2016/08/swingers.jpg"alt="Swingers (1996) by Doug Liman"height="645"width="1200"layout="responsive"></amp-img><p>The list of quotes is sorted in chronological order, with the oldest on the top:<p><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra"><strong>Edsger W.
