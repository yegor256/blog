      <h1>Objects Without Methods</h1>
      <p>What do you think an object is in OOP? No matter what language you are
programming with, you will most probably agree with Bruce Eckel,
the author of <a href="https://amzn.to/3pRHv1Q">Thinking in Java</a>, who said that “each object has a state
and operations that you can ask it to perform,” or
Benjamin Evans, the author of <a href="https://amzn.to/35uKVPU">Java in a Nutshell</a>, who claimed that it is
“a collection of data fields that hold values and methods that operate on those values.”
However, hold on… What if I told you that an object may have no “operations”
and still be a perfect “equivalent of the quanta from which the universe
is constructed,” as David West suggested in his great book
<a href="https://amzn.to/3kuXHlL">Object Thinking</a>?</p>



<amp-img src="/images/2020/11/the-ballad-of-buster-scruggs.jpg" alt="The Ballad of Buster Scruggs (2018) by Coen brothers" height="1000" width="1500" layout="responsive"></amp-img>

<p>In <a href="https://www.eolang.org">EO</a>,
our experimental programming language, we made an attempt to re-define
OOP and its objects. There are two types of <em>things</em> in EO: atoms and objects.
An atom is the lowest level language primitive, which can’t be expressed by
other atoms. For example, an arithmetic addition of two other objects is an atom
(stay with me, this is EO syntax, you will get used to it):</p>

<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>add 5 y &gt; x
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In a more traditional Java-like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix_notation">infix notation</a>
this code would look like this:</p>

<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>x = add(5, y)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The atom is <code class="highlighter-rouge">add</code> and its two specific
arguments are <code class="highlighter-rouge">5</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">y</code>. This statement creates a new atom, using
the existing one and specifying its arguments. The name of the new atom being
created is <code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code>. Once we ask this newly created atom to do anything,
it gets what’s in <code class="highlighter-rouge">y</code>, adds <code class="highlighter-rouge">5</code>, and starts behaving
like a summary of them. Until then, it stays quiet.
EO is a declarative language.</p>

<p>Atoms are provided by the EO runtime. For example,
<code class="highlighter-rouge">add</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">sub</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">mul</code>,  and <code class="highlighter-rouge">div</code> are for arithmetic operations;
<code class="highlighter-rouge">if</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">for</code> are for forking and iterating;
<code class="highlighter-rouge">less</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">and</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">eq</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">or</code> are for logical operations, and so on.
Atoms may resemble low-level functions with arguments.
However, they don’t calculate results immediately, but only when needed.
Saying <code class="highlighter-rouge">add(5, file)</code> won’t lead to reading the content
of the file and adding 5 to it immediately. Only when the
created atom is dealt with will the file reading happen.</p>

<p>Next, on top of these atoms, objects can be created by a programmer.
For example, this is an object that represents a circle:</p>

<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>[r] &gt; circle
  mul 2 3.14 r &gt; perimeter
  mul 3.14 r r &gt; area
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The first line creates an “abstract” object named <code class="highlighter-rouge">circle</code>. It is abstract,
because one of its attributes <code class="highlighter-rouge">r</code> is “free”. It’s not specified
in this object and that’s why the object can’t be used as is, it has
to be copied with <code class="highlighter-rouge">r</code> specified. For example, this is the circle <code class="highlighter-rouge">c</code>
with the radius 30:</p>

<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>circle 30 &gt; c
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The object <code class="highlighter-rouge">circle</code> has three attributes. The first one is <code class="highlighter-rouge">r</code>, which is free.
The other two are <code class="highlighter-rouge">perimeter</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">area</code>. They are “bounded,” since their
atoms are already defined: <code class="highlighter-rouge">mul</code> in both cases. To get the area of the
circle <code class="highlighter-rouge">c</code> we do this:</p>

<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>c.area &gt; a
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It looks like a method call, but it’s not. We don’t call a method, we just
take an <code class="highlighter-rouge">area</code> object from the object <code class="highlighter-rouge">c</code>. It’s not created for us
at the moment we do <code class="highlighter-rouge">c.area</code>! It has already been there sitting and waiting
for us to take it. It was created right when the object <code class="highlighter-rouge">c</code> was built.</p>



<p>This is the difference between methods in Java and attributes in EO.
In Java, every method is a procedure to be executed as soon as it’s
called. This method calling (or message sending, according to
<a href="/2017/12/12/alan-kay-was-wrong.html">early OOP adepts</a>)
mechanism was inherited from C functions,
which itself we inherited from ALGOL procedures, I believe.
EO does it differently. There is no method calling. It just takes attributes out
of objects and gives them to other objects, until control is
passed to them and it gets down to the level of atoms.</p>

<p>In the example above, the object <code class="highlighter-rouge">a</code> is not a calculated number.
It’s an atom <code class="highlighter-rouge">mul</code> that encapsulates <code class="highlighter-rouge">3.14</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">30</code> (the radius). The
result of the calculation is not yet known. If we don’t do anything
with <code class="highlighter-rouge">a</code>, the CPU will never do the calculation. However, if we decide
to, say, print the number to the console, the calculation will happen:</p>

<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>stdout
  sprintf
    "Radius is %d, Area is %d"
    r
    a
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here, the atom <code class="highlighter-rouge">sprintf</code> constructs the string, which encapsulates
three attributes: the text, <code class="highlighter-rouge">r</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">a</code>. By the way,
it’s possible to use either vertical or horizontal notation
for constructing objects. The code above may be written like this:</p>

<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>stdout (sprintf "Radius is %d, Area is %d" r a)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The atom <code class="highlighter-rouge">stdout</code> encapsulates the string constructed by <code class="highlighter-rouge">sprintf</code>
and stays quiet. It doesn’t print anything! Only when someone
at some point tries to “touch” this object, taking one of
its attributes out, the atom <code class="highlighter-rouge">stdout</code> will drop the line to the
console.</p>

<p>There are no attributes in <code class="highlighter-rouge">stdout</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">sprintf</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">mul</code>, and most
other atoms, except one: 𝜑.
Any object or atom has this specific attribute, also known as
the “body” of an object. Once someone attempts to touch <code class="highlighter-rouge">stdout.𝜑</code>,
the console will see the string.</p>

<p>Thus, we have objects, but we don’t have methods.
There are only attributes representing other objects.</p>
