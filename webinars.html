However, as we practitioners know, it doesn’t really work. Getters and setters don’t really help, but only make the code more complex. It is suggested to use a different approach to enforce decoupling: distance of coupling metric.<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9xyZVSo-HY"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/I9xyZVSo-HY/mqdefault.jpg"class="wnr"alt="Webinar no.53 by Yegor Bugayenko"></a>Jan 6, 2021<br>#54: <strong>How to Make a DSL with ANTLR4</strong><br>You can create your own Domain Specific Language (DSL) using ANTLR4 library in Java. Here we discuss how this can be done and create a new DSL in less than an hour.<h2 id="2020">2020</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u83tJkqQgU"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4u83tJkqQgU/mqdefault.jpg"class="wnr"alt="Webinar no.53 by Yegor Bugayenko"></a>Dec 2, 2020<br>#53: <strong>Best Practices of Exception Throwing</strong><br>We discuss what are good and bad habits in exception throwing: how to create them, whether to use checked or unchecked, when to use more detailed and less detailed objects, and so on.<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZWHs1mloUw"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4ZWHs1mloUw/mqdefault.jpg"class="wnr"alt="Webinar no.52 by Yegor Bugayenko"></a>Nov 4, 2020<br>#52: <strong>RAII in Java</strong><br>Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII) is a design idea introduced in C++ by Bjarne Stroustrup for exception-safe resource management. Thanks to garbage collection Java doesn’t have this feature, but we can implement something similar, using try-with-resources. Let’s see how exactly.<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsWrgxm8ktU"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rsWrgxm8ktU/mqdefault.jpg"class="wnr"alt="Webinar no.51 by Yegor Bugayenko"></a>Oct 7, 2020<br>#51: <strong>Fat and Skinny Design</strong><br>It seems that type/class hierarchies in OOP may be designed in two extreme ways: either with full encapsulation of data in mind; or with just a few interfaces making raw data visible, and letting classes deal with it, parse it, and turn it into smaller data elements. You may be surprised, but I’m suggesting the second option is more elegant.<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nErn5G_JHhE"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nErn5G_JHhE/mqdefault.jpg"class="wnr"alt="Webinar no.50 by Yegor Bugayenko"></a>August 5, 2020<br>#50: <strong>Veil Objects to Replace DTOs</strong><br>We all know that DTOs (aka value objects) are evil. But what is the alternative when we need some data to be transferred temporarily? I’m suggesting Veil Objects and this webinar demonstrates how they are used.<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeXdDvIVu-Y"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eeXdDvIVu-Y/mqdefault.jpg"class="wnr"alt="Webinar no.49 by Yegor Bugayenko"></a>March 12, 2020<br>#49: <strong>What Is Cohesion in OOP?</strong><br>There are two important metrics in OOP: cohesion and coupling. The first one is the most interesting one since it can be measured. There are many ways to measure it. We discuss which of them make sense and why we should care.<h2 id="2019">2019</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3blBn65iQmU"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3blBn65iQmU/mqdefault.jpg"class="wnr"alt="Webinar no.48 by Yegor Bugayenko"></a>December 4, 2019<br>#48: <strong>Why Private Static Literals are Evil?</strong><br>The most commonly used solution for the code duplication code is private static constants, which sometimes stay in the same class, but very often reside in a special Constants utility class. This approach is very wrong and only kills your design.<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AfBsXOgx1s"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6AfBsXOgx1s/mqdefault.jpg"class="wnr"alt="Webinar no.47 by Yegor Bugayenko"></a>November 6, 2019<br>#47: <strong>Aspect Oriented Programming: Pros and Cons</strong><br>AOP is a very powerful technique, which is so easily can be abused. We discuss how it works, what is it for, and how to use it responsively in order to stay object-oriented.<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNtTAF0UjjA"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oNtTAF0UjjA/mqdefault.jpg"class="wnr"alt="Webinar no.46 by Yegor Bugayenko"></a>August 7, 2019<br>#46: <strong>Xembly, an imperative language for XML manipulations</strong><br>Xembly is an “Assembly for XML”, an imperative language for building and modifying XML documents. I’m using it in many Java projects where I need to build or modify XML pages. Here is a live demonstration of its features.<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_d3AmqeGcMU"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_d3AmqeGcMU/mqdefault.jpg"class="wnr"alt="Webinar no.45 by Yegor Bugayenko"></a>July 3, 2019<br>#45: <strong>How Much Immutability Is Enough</strong><br>Immutability is a virtue in object-oriented programming, but very often it is being confused with constants. Those are different things. Immutable objects are not constants and there are a lot of possibilities to make an object immutable but still ready to accept changes.<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoXV_scCMNY"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SoXV_scCMNY/mqdefault.jpg"class="wnr"alt="Webinar no.44 by Yegor Bugayenko"></a>June 12, 2019<br>#44: <strong>Logging, the Object-Oriented Way</strong><br>How do you log events from your objects? Do you use static loggers? Do you use static methods? If you do, you are doing it wrong. There is a better, a more object-oriented way to do that.<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVzEPOZ_mDU"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bVzEPOZ_mDU/mqdefault.jpg"class="wnr"alt="Webinar no.42 by Yegor Bugayenko"></a>February 13, 2019<br>#42: <strong>A practical example of making an object-oriented HTTP server in Java</strong><br>Most web frameworks hide the details of HTTP requests processing from software developers, making it difficult to design a web application right; in the webinar we analyze how it can be done right, in an object-oriented way.<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8JMaMXydbs"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u8JMaMXydbs/mqdefault.jpg"class="wnr"alt="Webinar no.41 by Yegor Bugayenko"></a>January 2, 2019<br>#41: <strong>How many RETURN statements is enough?</strong><br>Multiple RETURN statements are considered as bad practice in object-oriented programming. We analyze practical examples and see why exactly those statements are bad or not. The discussion is in this blog post: <a href="/2015/08/18/multiple-return-statements-in-oop.html"><em>Why Many Return Statements Are a Bad Idea in OOP</em></a>.<h2 id="2018">2018</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLHdZnrlPD8"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gLHdZnrlPD8/mqdefault.jpg"class="wnr"alt="Webinar no.40 by Yegor Bugayenko"></a>December 5, 2018<br>#40: <strong>The Power of Decorators</strong><br>The Decorator design pattern is a powerful tool in object-oriented programming. There is a real practical example demonstrated, from Zold source code.<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uznmzI7qsvI"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uznmzI7qsvI/mqdefault.jpg"class="wnr"alt="Webinar no.39 by Yegor Bugayenko"></a>November 7, 2018<br>#39: <strong>A practical example of ORM-free persistence layer</strong><br>There is a demonstration of a real web application (<a href="https://www.mailanes.com">mailanes.com</a>), where the persistence layer is designed without the use of any ORM frameworks, on top of plain PostgreSQL Ruby SDK.<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIyAZRRgWPg"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GIyAZRRgWPg/mqdefault.jpg"class="wnr"alt="Webinar no.38 by Yegor Bugayenko"></a>October 3, 2018<br>#38: <strong>Parsing Objects vs Parsers</strong><br>The Parser is a very commonly used pattern in OOP, which is actually not very object-oriented; a better alternative is parsing objects. The discussion is based on this: <a href="/2018/02/27/parsing-objects.html"><em>Don’t Parse, Use Parsing Objects</em></a>.<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXj9UWm1134"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oXj9UWm1134/mqdefault.jpg"class="wnr"alt="Webinar no.37 by Yegor Bugayenko"></a>September 12, 2018<br>#37: <strong>Names of objects, methods and variables in OOP</strong><br>Finding the right name for a class, a method, an object, an attribute or a variable is a complex task in OOP. There are a few thoughts and practical examples.<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNWyN_Q10TI"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FNWyN_Q10TI/mqdefault.jpg"class="wnr"alt="Webinar no.36 by Yegor Bugayenko"></a>August 8, 2018<br>#36: <strong>What’s wrong with global variables?</strong><br>We all know that global variables are evil, but most of us keep using them. Here we discuss what exactly is wrong with them. The discussion is based on this blog post: <a href="/2018/07/03/global-variables.html"><em>What’s Wrong With Global Variables?</em></a><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-drZbHxydMc"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-drZbHxydMc/mqdefault.jpg"class="wnr"alt="Webinar no.35 by Yegor Bugayenko"></a>July 4, 2018<br>#35: <strong>When do you validate your objects?</strong><br>Very often we need to validate our objects for consistency, before working with them. A file may be absent, a database connection may get lost, a data structure may contain invalid information, and so on. When is the right moment to validate that, in a constructor or some time later, in a method? <a href="/2018/05/29/object-validation.html"><em>Object Validation: to Defer or Not?</em></a><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRyqiQehBk"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NQRyqiQehBk/mqdefault.jpg"class="wnr"alt="Webinar no.34 by Yegor Bugayenko"></a>May 10, 2018<br>#34: <strong>How to Get Rid of the NEW Operator</strong><br>We discussed what was wrong with the operator NEW and how object-oriented code could get rid of it. More details here: <a href="/2018/01/02/operator-new-is-toxic.html"><em>Operator new() is Toxic</em></a>.<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REj8pJesMVI"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/REj8pJesMVI/mqdefault.jpg"class="wnr"alt="Webinar no.33 by Yegor Bugayenko"></a>April 4, 2018<br>#33: <strong>The Alternative to Fluent Interfaces in Java</strong><br>We discussed fluent interfaces design pattern by example. We tried to create an HTTP client as an alternative to jcabi-http, without fluent interfaces, but only with decorators and smart objects. This blog post explains the idea: <a href="/2018/03/13/fluent-interfaces.html"><em>Fluent Interfaces Are Bad for Maintainability</em></a>.<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC17YwowURQ"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rC17YwowURQ/mqdefault.jpg"class="wnr"alt="Webinar no.32 by Yegor Bugayenko"></a>February 7, 2018<br>#32: <strong>Synchronized Decorators for Thread-Safety</strong><br>We discussed thread-safety in OOP and synchronized decorators to solve the problem. The discussion was based on this blog post: <a href="/2017/01/17/synchronized-decorators.html"><em>Synchronized Decorators to Replace Thread-Safe Classes</em></a>.<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcy53ZSF78o"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Wcy53ZSF78o/mqdefault.jpg"class="wnr"alt="Webinar no.31 by Yegor Bugayenko"></a>January 3, 2018<br>#31: <strong>Decorating Envelopes</strong><br>We discussed a simple object-oriented technique I keep using in my projects and find very convenient, it was discussed in this blog post: <a href="/2017/01/31/decorating-envelopes.html"><em>Decorating Envelopes</em></a> earlier.<h2 id="2017">2017</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WmsiV22IXM"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7WmsiV22IXM/mqdefault.jpg"class="wnr"alt="Webinar no.30 by Yegor Bugayenko"></a>December 13, 2017<br>#30: <strong>Lazy Loading via Java Lambda</strong><br>We went through a number of functional interfaces and classes of Cactoos library and saw how they can be used in order to implement Lazy Loading in an object-oriented way.<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z70PMGaxGhY"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z70PMGaxGhY/mqdefault.jpg"class="wnr"alt="Webinar no.29 by Yegor Bugayenko"></a>November 1, 2017<br>#29: <strong>How to win $4096 in the next year Quality Award?</strong><br>I’ve shown by examples what quality meant for me when I was deciding which project deserved to be the winner in the annual Quality Award.<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYd24FN58wg"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KYd24FN58wg/mqdefault.jpg"class="wnr"alt="Webinar no.28 by Yegor Bugayenko"></a>October 4, 2017<br>#28: <strong>Object-Oriented Java Web App from Scratch in One Hour: ThreeCopies.com</strong><br>We discussed a fully functional web app in Java, which was built with the best principles of object-oriented programming in mind.
