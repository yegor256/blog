However, <a href="https://github.com/FlorianRappl">Florian Rappl</a> <a href="https://www.florian-rappl.de/News/Page/227/bug-driven-development">argues</a> that it’s not. <a href="https://github.com/benwinding">Ben Winding</a> <a href="https://blog.benwinding.com/bug-driven-development-sometimes-its-the-best-choice/">believes</a> that it’s better than TDD. In simple words, BDD is kind of like trying to build a plane while it’s flying, based on passenger complaints. Nobody builds planes like that (well, maybe <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-the-boeing-737-max-disaster-looks-to-a-software-developer">Boeing</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/20/airbus-issues-alert-software-bug-fatal-plane-crash">Airbus</a>). However, a software team that practices BDD might demonstrate higher productivity.</p><amp-img src="/images/2025/05/ghost-dog.jpg"alt="Ghost Dog (1999) by Jim Jarmush"height="720"width="1280"layout="responsive"></amp-img><p>A software team does BDD if it follows one simple principle: Every piece of work is formulated as a <strong>complaint</strong>.<p>It started <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2559439_An_Overview_of_the_Software_Engineering_Process_and_Tools_in_the_Mozilla_Project">in 2002</a>, by Mozilla:<blockquote><p>Every code change in the Mozilla codebase is made as part of a “fix” for a uniquely numbered “bug.” Though it commonly has a pejorative connotation, in the Mozilla Project the term bug is used to refer to any filed request for modification in the software, be it an actual defect, an enhancement, or a change in functionality.</blockquote><p>If you listen to Mozilla’s advice, you won’t have feature requests, or questions, or tasks in your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issue_tracking_system">issue tracking system</a>. Only bug reports. They may sound like “The wing is on fire!”—a perfect complaint—or “A plane doesn’t have a jacuzzi!”—a perfect feature request in the form of a complaint. Questions may also look like complaints: “It is unclear how to fasten the belt.” Whether they are coming from testers or customers, the format is the same: “I don’t like it.”<p>The primary benefit that BDD can give to a project is <strong>noise reduction</strong>. I can think of two reasons for that:<ol><li><p>Complaints, due to their rather aggressive nature, require their authors to provide strong arguments to back them up. They must think twice before submitting a ticket that accuses the codebase of being broken or imperfect. They must be specific and precise. No noise.<li><p>Similarly, programmers must convince a complainant that the problem is resolved. They can’t close the ticket with just a text answer. They need to demonstrate a reasonably significant contribution to the codebase. No noise.</ol><p>A good complaint identifies a <strong>flaw</strong> in something tangible. A good resolution of a good complaint is a <strong>patch</strong> to that tangible something. Obviously, in a software project, the <strong>source code</strong> is what is tangible.<p>In a disciplined team, every ticket is a bug report that addresses a flaw in the source code. Every bug report leads to a patch—a contribution to the source code. No noise. The team is focused and demonstrates the best possible productivity.<p>BDD also has a major drawback. It may be hard to train the team to use it. The adoption of BDD may require a change of their <strong>mindset</strong>. They must switch from noise-makers to flaw-finders.<p><a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/about-me/">Jeff Atwood</a>, in his blog post about <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/complaint-driven-development/">complaint-driven development</a>, explains it from a business point of view. He suggests that instead of implementing what you believe is right, it’s better to give your customers a rough draft and let them complain. You’re most often wrong about what they’ll actually complain about. The more they complain, the better you listen, the bigger the value you deliver.</article>
