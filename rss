&lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/16/json-vs-xml.html&quot;&gt;many other&lt;/a&gt; data formats is that
it is human-readable. Well, to some extent, you may say. Indeed, a badly
formatted XML document may be rather difficult to digest. I&amp;#39;m not talking about
XML &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-formed_document&quot;&gt;validity&lt;/a&gt;
now, but about its formatting style. Just like we format our
Java/Ruby/Python nicely and then check their &amp;quot;prettiness&amp;quot; with static analyzers,
we can also check our XML documents. Six years ago I asked the StackOverflow community
for such a tool, but unfortunately
&lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6091873/&quot;&gt;my question&lt;/a&gt;
was down-voted and closed
(you will need 10K+ reputation to see it).
Last week I finally decided to create a tool myself and I called it
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256/xcop&quot;&gt;xcop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;figure class=&#39;jb_picture&#39;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&#39;image&#39; alt=&#39;L&amp;#39;appartement (1996) by Gilles Mimouni&#39; src=&#39;/images/2017/08/lappartement.jpg&#39; longdesc=&#39;#470ac825&#39;/&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&#39;470ac825&#39;&gt;L&amp;#39;appartement (1996) by Gilles Mimouni&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a very simple command line
&lt;a href=&quot;https://rubygems.org/gems/xcop&quot;&gt;Ruby gem&lt;/a&gt;.
First, you install it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ gem install xcop&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then you ask it to check your XML file, say &lt;code&gt;pom.xml&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ xcop pom.xml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the file is not &amp;quot;pretty,&amp;quot; &lt;code&gt;xcop&lt;/code&gt; will complain and
show what&amp;#39;s wrong. You can ask &lt;code&gt;xcop&lt;/code&gt; to fix the file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ xcop --fix pom.xml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, in most cases you may need your XML files to include a license
in their headers, especially if it&amp;#39;s open source. To enforce that, just
point &lt;code&gt;xcop&lt;/code&gt; to the file with the license:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ xcop --license&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;LICENSE.txt pom.xml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe it&amp;#39;s good practice to use &lt;code&gt;xcop&lt;/code&gt; together with
Checkstyle (for Java files), Rubocop (for Ruby files), and other static
analyzers, to ensure that your XML files always look pretty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256/xcop&quot;&gt;Read&lt;/a&gt; how you can integrate &lt;code&gt;xcop&lt;/code&gt; with
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ruby/rake&quot;&gt;Rake&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://maven.apache.org/&quot;&gt;Maven&lt;/a&gt;, and other builders.
I will appreciate it if you contribute your own integrations too.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Yegor Bugayenko</name><email>yegor256@gmail.com</email></author><category term="xml" /><summary type="html">One of the biggest advantages of XML versus

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paulgraham.com/safe.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why It&amp;#39;s Safe for Founders to Be Nice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
written by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/paulg&quot;&gt;Paul Graham&lt;/a&gt;
(a co-founder or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ycombinator.com/&quot;&gt;Y Combinator&lt;/a&gt;), whom I honestly respect,
and I decided to explain why I disagree. Not that I think we shouldn&amp;#39;t
be nice. Not at all. But I do think that &amp;quot;being nice&amp;quot; is not a solution for organizational,
management, marketing, sales, or business development problems. Moreover,
in most cases it is actually &lt;em&gt;not safe&lt;/em&gt; for founders to be nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;figure class=&#39;jb_picture&#39;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&#39;image&#39; alt=&#39;Scarecrow (1973) by Jerry Schatzberg&#39; src=&#39;/images/2017/08/scarecrow.jpg&#39; longdesc=&#39;#04c96f77&#39;/&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&#39;04c96f77&#39;&gt;Scarecrow (1973) by Jerry Schatzberg&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graham in his article quotes a founder who explains
his worries about being &amp;quot;fundamentally soft-hearted and tending to give
away too much for free.&amp;quot; Then he suggests the founder should not worry too
much, because &amp;quot;as long as you build something good enough to spread by word of mouth,
you&amp;#39;ll have a hyperlinear growth curve.&amp;quot; In other words, don&amp;#39;t worry about
your &lt;em&gt;softness&lt;/em&gt; and instead focus on building a great product&amp;mdash;your efforts
will be appreciated. But will this really work in the modern world?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will, provided you&amp;#39;re a talented mathematician, or a composer, or
maybe a writer, where your success doesn&amp;#39;t really depend on people close to you, like
employees, partners, and investors. However, developing a business is
a different story, where success mostly depends on your ability to
generate &lt;em&gt;profit&lt;/em&gt;, which, by definition, is &amp;quot;taking more and returning less.&amp;quot;
What kind of a soft heart will be happy to do that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;aside class=&#39;quote&#39;&gt;In a nutshell, we are either soft-hearted or successful.&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://foolishnessfile.com/soft-hearted-mistakes/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;7 Soft Hearted Mistakes Startup Founders Make&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
perfectly summarizes how softness may become a weakness,
if we fail to take it under control. In a nutshell,
we are either soft-hearted or successful.
This &amp;quot;weakness&amp;quot; is affecting more people every year, since the entire
world, especially its &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/millennial-men-have-gone-soft--but-its-not-our-fault/&quot;&gt;male part&lt;/a&gt;,
is tending to soften up, mostly thanks to the rapidly growing quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some of us, who, like that founder, are &amp;quot;fundamentally soft-hearted,&amp;quot;
doing business and generating profit is a very stressful activity.
We have to do what goes against our inner self and take advantage of others.
Telling us that it is perfectly safe to &amp;quot;be nice&amp;quot; in this situation
is not ethical&amp;mdash;this disarms us and makes us vulnerable in front of those
who don&amp;#39;t have the &amp;quot;disease of soft-heartedness.&amp;quot;
Is there a better recipe out there to heal our illness?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though I&amp;#39;m trying to think of myself as not a weak person,
I have plenty of soft-heartedness disease symptoms. For example, I feel
guilty when:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I fire an employee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I negotiate someone down&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I punish someone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;#39;t pick up the phone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I say &amp;quot;No&amp;quot; to an offer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;#39;t trust people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I break up with a girl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;#39;t return my mom&amp;#39;s calls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any successful business person, including Paul Graham, who deals with hundreds
of startups every year, would tell you that in order to achieve something
you have to take many steps that will make many people around you &lt;em&gt;unhappy&lt;/em&gt;.
You have to fire people, say &amp;quot;No&amp;quot; to them, punish them, never return their phone calls, and
rarely trust anyone. But we&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;fundamentally soft-hearted&amp;quot; and simply
can&amp;#39;t do that every day&amp;mdash;it&amp;#39;s too stressful for us. However, we also
want to be successful in business! We don&amp;#39;t want to be mathematicians, or
composers, or just Java programmers. We want to move up in business.
What do we do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me share the recipe I found for myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;aside class=&#39;quote&#39;&gt;The only possible way to get rid of guilt is to replace it with a greater guilt.&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, we develop soft-heartedness when we grow up, mostly
under the influence of our parents. As kids we quickly learn that in
order to survive and have something to eat we must make those grown-ups
happy, or at least not disappoint them. Later on we call this
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenberglas/2012/06/07/6-signs-you-are-suffering-from-guilt-and-probably-dont-know-it/#2920e0b67a24&quot;&gt;guilt-driven behavior&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;quot;soft-heartedness&amp;quot; and become &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lifehack.org/articles/communication/8-problems-you-face-when-you-have-soft-heart.html&quot;&gt;proud of it&lt;/a&gt;.
But I believe it&amp;#39;s unfixable. Those who were traumatized by guilt in their childhood
will never be able to offend somebody and walk away without any negative
feelings. They are scarred forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only possible way to get rid of guilt is to replace it with a greater guilt.
For example, you just bought two ice cream cups and a friend asks you to give him one.
You can&amp;#39;t say &amp;quot;No&amp;quot; because you would feel guilty for making him unhappy.
But you remember that your mom told you to buy two cups and
bring both of them home. You would feel even more guilt if you made your mom
unhappy. So you say &amp;quot;No&amp;quot; to your friend and run home. Of course, you also can&amp;#39;t
eat the ice cream yourself, even though you want it&amp;mdash;you are afraid to make
your mother unhappy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same principle may be applied to business. But instead of having a controlling
parent you can define your own &amp;quot;rules of doing business.&amp;quot; Those rules will
be stronger than any particular situation you&amp;#39;re facing at any particular moment.
For example, you can decide when and why you answer your emails and phone calls,
what &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html&quot;&gt;should happen&lt;/a&gt;
for your employee to be discharged, how exactly you
&lt;a href=&quot;/2016/01/05/how-to-punish-employees.html&quot;&gt;punish&lt;/a&gt;
your employees, how your relationship with partners are
&lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/17/convertible-notes.html&quot;&gt;structured&lt;/a&gt;, etc.
This document, or set of documents, will be more important for you than
any particular person or situation. You will feel much more guilt for
disobeying the rules than for making someone unhappy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least this is what works for me. Call it self-discipline or a systematic
approach to doing business, but in reality it&amp;#39;s just a countermeasure against
guilt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize, and to answer the question whether it is safe for a business person
to be nice, I would say that it is very unsafe. But &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; being nice is obviously not
a solution either, because anyone asking this question clearly wants to be nice.
Thus, the only solution I managed to find is a personal
code of conduct, which helps me be effective and not stressed at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Yegor Bugayenko</name><email>yegor256@gmail.com</email></author><category term="management" /><summary type="html">I stumbled upon this two-year-old article

Will it go up? Or down? What would you do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where did that profit come from?
How can Coinbase pay me eight times more now than I paid them less than a year ago?
Where did they get that cash?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&#39;badge&#39;&gt;&lt;img src=&#39;http://www.yegor256.com/images/2017/08/coinbase-1.jpg&#39; style=&#39;width:200px;max-width:100%;&#39; alt=&#39;badge&#39;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously you know what a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponzi_scheme&quot;&gt;Ponzi scheme&lt;/a&gt; is, right?
If you don&amp;#39;t, watch
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1811261/&quot;&gt;Episode 16&lt;/a&gt;
of the 8th Season of
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0369179/&quot;&gt;Two and a Half Men&lt;/a&gt;.
In a nutshell, I&amp;#39;m getting my investment and my profit from other people, who are
paying Coinbase for my BTCs. If there were no demand,
my entire investment would disappear and I would only have the BTC bits
and bytes in my virtual wallet. I would lose my $1,222.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some recent articles call &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin&quot;&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; and other
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency&quot;&gt;altcoins&lt;/a&gt;,
like
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum&quot;&gt;Etherium&lt;/a&gt; or
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litecoin&quot;&gt;Litecoin&lt;/a&gt;, Ponzi schemes,
for example,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/05/cryptocurrency-ponzi-schemes/528624/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Rise of Cryptocurrency Ponzi Schemes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
in The Atlantic
and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/b5d66ed8-d1b3-11e6-b06b-680c49b4b4c0&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bitcoin passes $1,000 but only number that matters is zero&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
in the Financial Times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the key attribute of a pyramid scheme is right there:
the product being sold has no value aside from the demand-generated one,
just like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/finance?q=TWTR&quot;&gt;Twitter stocks&lt;/a&gt;.
Should we blame Bitcoin for that? I don&amp;#39;t think so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that what Coinbase (and similar traders like
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.coinmama.com&quot;&gt;CoinMama&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cex.io&quot;&gt;CEX.io&lt;/a&gt;) are doing is definitely
a pyramid and must be stopped by the government, sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine, I start a company tomorrow. I call it YegorBase.
It will buy and sell YegorCoins, which I will also create.
The price will be $100 a piece. Some of you
may buy that, especially because it will be possible to sell them the next day,
when the price will be $101. Initially I will create some fuss to promote
the product and the trading will begin. I will make my commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will this be legal? I seriously doubt that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stripe.com&quot;&gt;Stripe&lt;/a&gt;,
for example, would approve my account if I told them my business plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the problem is not the YegorCoin itself&amp;mdash;there is nothing wrong in
creating your own crypto-electronic-whatever-product. The problem is that I&amp;#39;ll
be trading something that has a very questionable value, being completely
unregulated by the government. The trading of my YegorCoin,
just like shares of stocks, bonds, options, gold, and Bitcoin, must be
regulated by the people we&amp;#39;re paying our taxes to&amp;mdash;the police.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may say that Coinbase is not issuing those Bitcoins and only trading
them&amp;mdash;and that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s not a pyramid. Not true. In my YegorBase shop
I won&amp;#39;t need to issue my YegorCoins for very long. As soon as the total volume
of YegorCoins is big enough, the situation will control itself
and the price will jump and fall somehow. I will make profit on the trading
commission and the owners of YegorCoin will hope that they can manage
to sell everything before my shop gets busted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why the police are still closing their eyes to what Coinbase is doing,
I simply can&amp;#39;t understand. Maybe because NYSE and A16Z are among their
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/coinbase/investors&quot;&gt;long list&lt;/a&gt;
of investors?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Yegor Bugayenko</name><email>yegor256@gmail.com</email></author><category term="economics" /><summary type="html">In September 2016 I paid Coinbase

&lt;p&gt;The problem RAII is solving is obvious; have a look at this code
(I&amp;#39;m sure you know what
&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Semaphore.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Semaphore&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
is and how it works in Java):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Foo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Semaphore&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Semaphore&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;sem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;acquire&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Too large!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;printf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;x = %d&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;sem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;release&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code is rather primitive and doesn&amp;#39;t do anything useful, but you
most probably get the idea: the method &lt;code&gt;print()&lt;/code&gt;, if being called from
multiple parallel threads, will allow only five of them to print
in parallel. Sometimes it will not allow some of them to print and will
throw an exception if &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is bigger than &lt;code&gt;1000&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with this code is&amp;mdash;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_leak&quot;&gt;resource leakage&lt;/a&gt;.
Each &lt;code&gt;print()&lt;/code&gt; call
with &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; larger than &lt;code&gt;1000&lt;/code&gt; will take one permit from the semaphore and
won&amp;#39;t return it. In five calls with exceptions
the semaphore will be empty and all other threads won&amp;#39;t print anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the solution? Here it is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Foo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Semaphore&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Semaphore&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;sem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;acquire&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;sem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;release&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Too large!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;printf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;x = %d&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;sem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;release&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must release the permit before we throw the exception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is another problem that shows up: code duplication. We release
the permit in two places. If we add more &lt;code&gt;throw&lt;/code&gt; instructions we will
also have to add more &lt;code&gt;sem.release()&lt;/code&gt; calls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very elegant solution was introduced in C++ and is called RAII. This
is how it would look in Java:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Permit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Semaphore&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Permit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Semaphore&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;sem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;sem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;acquire&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Override&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;finalize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;sem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;release&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Foo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Semaphore&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Semaphore&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Permit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;sem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Too large!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;printf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;x = %d&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See how beautiful the code is inside method &lt;code&gt;Foo.print()&lt;/code&gt;. We just create
an instance of class &lt;code&gt;Permit&lt;/code&gt; and it immediately acquires a new permit
at the semaphore. Then we exit the method &lt;code&gt;print()&lt;/code&gt;, either by exception
or in the normal way, and the method &lt;code&gt;Permit.finalize()&lt;/code&gt; releases the permit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elegant, isn&amp;#39;t it? Yes, it is, but it won&amp;#39;t work in Java.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It won&amp;#39;t work because, unlike C++, Java doesn&amp;#39;t destroy objects when
their scope of visibility is closed. The object of class &lt;code&gt;Permit&lt;/code&gt; won&amp;#39;t
be destroyed when we exit the method &lt;code&gt;print()&lt;/code&gt;. It will be destroyed
&lt;em&gt;eventually&lt;/em&gt; but we don&amp;#39;t know when exactly. Most likely it will be
destroyed way after all permits in the semaphore got acquired and we
get blocked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a solution in Java too. It is not as elegant as the one from
C++, but it does work. Here it is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Permit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Closeable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Semaphore&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Permit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Semaphore&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;sem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Override&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;close&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;sem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;release&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Permit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;acquire&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;sem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;acquire&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Foo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Too large!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;printf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;x = %d&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pay attention to the &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt; block and to the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/Closeable.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Closeable&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; interface
that the class &lt;code&gt;Permit&lt;/code&gt; now implements. The object &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; will be &amp;quot;closed&amp;quot;
when the &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt; block exits. It may exit either at the end, or
by the &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;throw&lt;/code&gt; statements. In either case &lt;code&gt;Permit.close()&lt;/code&gt;
will be called: this is how
&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/tryResourceClose.html&quot;&gt;try-with-resources&lt;/a&gt;
works in Java.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I introduced method &lt;code&gt;acquire()&lt;/code&gt; and moved &lt;code&gt;sem.acquire()&lt;/code&gt; out of the &lt;code&gt;Permit&lt;/code&gt; constructor because I
&lt;a href=&quot;/2015/05/07/ctors-must-be-code-free.html&quot;&gt;believe&lt;/a&gt;
that constructors must be code-free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize, RAII is a perfect design &lt;del&gt;pattern&lt;/del&gt; approach when you
deal with resources that may &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_leak&quot;&gt;leak&lt;/a&gt;.

Some of them are
great, while many are simply idiots. What do you do if you happen
to have a boss that fits perfectly into this dominating category?
Quit and try to find a better place? This may sound like good
advice, but you know as well as I do that a new boss most likely won&amp;#39;t
be any better. Don&amp;#39;t quit. Stay. Manage the manager. Most of them are
manageable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;figure class=&#39;jb_picture&#39;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&#39;image&#39; alt=&#39;The Intouchables (2011) by  Olivier Nakache&#39; src=&#39;/images/2017/07/intouchables.jpg&#39; longdesc=&#39;#ae07a826&#39;/&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&#39;ae07a826&#39;&gt;The Intouchables (2011) by  Olivier Nakache&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, remember your goal: do &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;get paid&lt;/em&gt;. It&amp;#39;s hardly
achievable to its full extent, but you can get very close.
Doing something useful two hours a week and collecting a paycheck
for forty hours is what a professional engineer must aim for. The other
38 hours you will spend on your own projects, your open source
ideas, your education, your dreams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest problem on the road to this success is the manager, who
is hired exactly to prevent this from happening. Managers use multiple
instruments to catch you and force you to give them your &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt;. Here
is what I did in these situations against a really annoying
manager I once had:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tasks&lt;/strong&gt;.
Believe it or not he would assign some coding tasks to me.
I would do them very slowly or not do them at all. With a serious
shortage of programmers on the market and my relatively good profile
he wasn&amp;#39;t able to fire me. So he had to put up with the fact that I
simply didn&amp;#39;t write any code, no matter how many tasks were assigned. Very
soon he gave up this idea and stopped giving me anything. I basically
created an image of a very skilled engineer who didn&amp;#39;t write code. No matter
how much you asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meetings&lt;/strong&gt;.
At the beginning he was calling me to all possible meetings,
because he thought that I was very smart. I was even smarter than he thought:
in each meeting I expressed my opinions in a very aggressive and conflict-provoking
way. And I always had enough opinions to express. Very soon he stopped
calling me to those hours-long meetings because I was simply ruining them,
making strong points, and never &amp;quot;being nice.&amp;quot; Then, when he stopped
calling, I pretended to be offended, as if I really wanted to
contribute and yet they were all ignoring me. Guilt is a very powerful management
instrument you know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reports&lt;/strong&gt;.
From time to time he was interested to know what was going on, mostly
by email or in Slack chat. I always had a very long list of things I was
&amp;quot;working on,&amp;quot; which were absolutely cryptic to him. He was not a programmer
and didn&amp;#39;t have enough courage to verify my claims. Any time he asked
what I was busy with, I sent him something like
&amp;quot;HDFS reconfig for Docker image&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Integration tests for JAX-RS endpoints.&amp;quot;
He was happy to see that I was very busy and he left me alone for another
week or two. Actually, I would recommend you send such reports to your managers
pro-actively, before they even ask. This will make them feel even more comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morning Stand-ups&lt;/strong&gt;.
These are annoying and very dangerous, because
other programmers may catch your lies about &amp;quot;HDFS and Docker.&amp;quot; The best
defense is offense: I always acted very interested in what other
people were working on. I always asked additional questions too, making
them afraid of me. It worked. They never bothered me with their suspicions.
Try not to avoid the stand-up meetings&amp;mdash;if a manager sees you there
they assume that you&amp;#39;re actually working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advice&lt;/strong&gt;.
He would ask me for technical advice, to help him make his decisions. This is
rather risky, because eventually you have to be responsible for the
advice you give, especially if you are a lead developer or an architect.
The best way to avoid this risk is to transfer responsibility to someone else.
I was always trying to ask somebody in the team to help me: to analyze the
problem and create a short email/report with pros and cons. Junior programmers
are usually very interested in doing such a favor for someone more senior.
Then, I just forwarded that email to the manager. Very soon he stopped
coming to me for the analysis and asked the junior guys directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emails&lt;/strong&gt;.
Long email threads are very annoying especially in big teams. I never read
them. You should not read them either, if you value your time. However,
you can&amp;#39;t just ignore them because everybody will feel that you are either
lazy or a sociopath. Neither of which is in your favor. What I always did
was pick up on any message from the thread and reply to it, with a question.
It&amp;#39;s called &lt;em&gt;trolling&lt;/em&gt;. You provoke others to keep the conversation going,
even though you&amp;#39;re not interested in it at all. A few emails like that a day and
people will think that you&amp;#39;re on top of everything in the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coaching&lt;/strong&gt;.
My manager would ask me every now and then to train new programmers and to help them out. This
too was very risky, since the new guys usually decided that I was their friend and
would talk to me about everything, consuming my time. To prevent this
from happening I would always try to introduce them to somebody else&amp;mdash;their
new friend. Everybody, if they don&amp;#39;t understand the consequences,
is happy to talk to junior programmers and to patronize them. I just had to forward
those juniors immediately to the right person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal meetings&lt;/strong&gt;.
This was the most annoying part of all: face-to-face meetings with the manager. He
asked me how happy I was in the team, what my plans were, what problems
I saw, etc. I was not able to say &amp;quot;Well, I&amp;#39;m happy that you guys are
still paying me and my biggest problem is that you annoy me far too often.&amp;quot;
Instead I had to invent plans, ideas, problems, and things that I wasn&amp;#39;t happy about.
I always kept a list of such things ready, in case a manager ever called
me for a meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was my strategy. How do you manage your managers?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Yegor Bugayenko</name><email>yegor256@gmail.com</email></author><category term="management" /><summary type="html">No secret, we you all have managers. Some of them are

&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/07/sites-google-drive.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gmail.com&quot;&gt;Gmail&lt;/a&gt;
is the best email system. It aggregates all my accounts
in one place: all emails are coming to the &lt;code&gt;@gmail.com&lt;/code&gt; address
and I have a few aliases for sending responses.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://calendar.google.com&quot;&gt;Google Calendar&lt;/a&gt; helps me keep my plans in sync,
and &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive&quot;&gt;Google Drive&lt;/a&gt; helps me
share documents with friends sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/07/sites-github.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;
is where we keep our source code repositories. I was also using
&lt;a href=&quot;https://bitbucket.com&quot;&gt;Bitbucket&lt;/a&gt;
a few years ago, but didn&amp;#39;t really like it.
GitHub is simply the best, no doubts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/07/sites-stackoverflow.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/users/187141/yegor256&quot;&gt;StackOverflow&lt;/a&gt;
is where I learn new technologies, ask questions, answer them sometimes
and really enjoy working with the community. When I have some free time
I just search by
&lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/design-patterns&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;design-patterns&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; or
&lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/oop&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;oop&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;
tags in order to find relevant questions and answer them if I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.wring.io/images/logo.svg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wring.io&quot;&gt;Wring&lt;/a&gt; aggregates my GitHub notifications
and helps me stay on top of all events that are happening there.
It&amp;#39;s my own project and I use it every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/07/sites-rultor.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rultor.com&quot;&gt;Rultor&lt;/a&gt; is helping me
&lt;a href=&quot;/2014/07/24/rultor-automated-merging.html&quot;&gt;merge&lt;/a&gt; pull requests,
&lt;a href=&quot;/2014/09/11/deployment-script-vs-rultor.html&quot;&gt;deploy&lt;/a&gt; my projects to production and
&lt;a href=&quot;/2014/08/19/how-to-release-to-maven-central.html&quot;&gt;release&lt;/a&gt;
their new versions. It&amp;#39;s one of my
&lt;a href=&quot;/pets.html&quot;&gt;pet projects&lt;/a&gt; and I&amp;#39;m using it every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/07/sites-heroku.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.heroku.com&quot;&gt;Heroku&lt;/a&gt; is where I host almost all my
Java and Ruby projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/07/sites-shippable.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://travis-ci.org&quot;&gt;Travis&lt;/a&gt; for open source and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://shippable.com&quot;&gt;Shippable&lt;/a&gt; for commercial projects, as
continuous integration platforms. There are
&lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/05/ten-hosted-continuous-integration-services.html&quot;&gt;many alternatives&lt;/a&gt;,
but I like these guys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/07/sites-godaddy.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.godaddy.com&quot;&gt;Godaddy&lt;/a&gt; is where I register all domain
names. Their user interface is terrible, but their
prices are the lowest. So, I&amp;#39;m with them for at least eight years already.&lt;/p&gt;

and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home&quot;&gt;Google Webmasters&lt;/a&gt;
are two systems where I track
my entire web traffic of all my websites. Both systems are terrible, performance
and interface wise. But since it&amp;#39;s Google, we have to stay with them,
to see how they understand web statistics. I&amp;#39;m also using
&lt;a href=&quot;https://hit.ua&quot;&gt;hit.ua&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;
are the social networks I&amp;#39;m spamming regularly. They are far from being
perfect, but they totally dominate the market.
I was using these guys, but they seem to be &lt;del&gt;dead&lt;/del&gt; less popular now:
LinkedIn, Google+.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/07/sites-amazon.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2ufwBbw&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;
is where I buy everything that is not food or clothes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/07/sites-aws.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/&quot;&gt;AWS&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/s3/&quot;&gt;my data&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/route53/&quot;&gt;my DNS&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/&quot;&gt;my servers&lt;/a&gt;,
and some other things. I&amp;#39;m with them since they
launched S3 (in 2006).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/07/sites-contabo.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://contabo.com/&quot;&gt;Contabo&lt;/a&gt;
is where I host servers, which I need 24x7. Their prices are great
and the service is pretty decent. I&amp;#39;m with them for at least five years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/07/sites-papertrail.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://papertrailapp.com/?thank=9e5dc6&quot;&gt;Papertrail&lt;/a&gt;
is where all my logs are being aggregated. I tried a few other
systems, but these guys seem to be the best. I even was paying them something
some time ago, but stopped&amp;mdash;their free package seems to be sufficient
enough for my volumes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/07/sites-statuscake.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statuscake.com/&quot;&gt;StatusCake&lt;/a&gt;
is a website monitoring system that keeps an eye on all my web

Let&amp;#39;s try to put emotions aside and analyze what&amp;#39;s happening
and what long-term consequences this panic may have for our
male-dominated engineering environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;figure class=&#39;jb_picture&#39;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&#39;image&#39; alt=&#39;Twentynine Palms (2003) by Bruno Dumont&#39; src=&#39;/images/2017/07/twentynine-palms.jpg&#39; longdesc=&#39;#c014ddd9&#39;/&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&#39;c014ddd9&#39;&gt;Twentynine Palms (2003) by Bruno Dumont&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will never know what really happened between those male investors and
female entrepreneurs behind closed doors, but the gist of the accusation
is that the former were &lt;em&gt;making advances&lt;/em&gt; towards the latter,
where it was clearly &lt;em&gt;inappropriate&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does that mean exactly? What, for example, did Dave McClure do in order
to be kicked out of the company he founded?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s see. According to Katie Benner from The New York Times,
he sent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/30/technology/women-entrepreneurs-speak-out-sexual-harassment.html&quot;&gt;this message&lt;/a&gt;
to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sarahkunst&quot;&gt;Sarah Kunst&lt;/a&gt;,
who was an applicant at his incubator in 2014 (other &amp;quot;harassers&amp;quot; were accused of
doing something very similar):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was getting confused figuring out whether to hire you or hit on you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously he was flirting. And what&amp;#39;s wrong with that? Can&amp;#39;t we flirt any more?
Is it a crime all of a sudden? One thing is wrong though. It was a &lt;em&gt;threat&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though this message didn&amp;#39;t say it explicitly, it actually &lt;em&gt;implied&lt;/em&gt;
that &amp;quot;you either go along and we go out, or you won&amp;#39;t be hired.&amp;quot; Of course,
&amp;quot;no hire&amp;quot; may not hurt as much as a knife or a fist in the face, but it
does hurt. Especially if you are a woman, a member of a minority group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a &lt;del&gt;sexist&lt;/del&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/07/04/sexism.html&quot;&gt;gentleman&lt;/a&gt;,
I feel bad when I see women being threatened. I want to protect them
and I expect our system of justice to help me, just
like it helps when we deal with physical violence.
These threats or attempts to threaten must be punished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is nothing wrong with the game between the sexes by itself. Just
like we don&amp;#39;t prohibit sex because we are afraid of rapists, we must not
stop asking women out because of our fear of a possible harassment accusation.
However, it seems that this is what is happening now: men are becoming &lt;em&gt;afraid&lt;/em&gt; of women.
Especially powerful men with money and status. They realize
that a small incautious step may help them become the next Dave or Travis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fear is destroying us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to this fear our &lt;em&gt;masculine&lt;/em&gt; characteristics become a victim of this dangerous game
that society is playing right now, with a noble intent to protect women against
verbal and psychological abuse. We men are losing our self-confidence,
our self-esteem, our &lt;del&gt;balls&lt;/del&gt; courage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fear mentally castrates us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must be absolutely clear that those harassers are guilty not because
they &amp;quot;made advances&amp;quot; towards women who work with them or for them, but because
they were &lt;em&gt;threatening&lt;/em&gt; those ladies. There is nothing wrong in being
attracted to a woman, no matter who she is: your boss, your employee, your
schoolmate, or the founder of the business you&amp;#39;re investing in. Moreover,
there is nothing wrong in making advances, falling in love, having sex
and marrying them. Threatening them in order to get all that is very wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not every flirtation is harassment. Not every man with a sexual
instinct is a rapist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How would I re-phrase that message to Sarah if I had been Dave and had fallen
in love with her at first sight? I would probably say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was getting confused, figuring out how to isolate my hiring process
from my desire to hit on you. How about dinner? I promise,
no matter how it ends, it will not affect our hiring decision at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realize that it&amp;#39;s not perfect, since she wouldn&amp;#39;t be completely
comfortable, and still might expect Dave&amp;#39;s feelings to affect his hiring decision
if it turns out she doesn&amp;#39;t like him or simply already has a partner. However,
this would seem like a respectful attempt to put the weapon down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to not threaten a woman if you&amp;#39;re holding a gun in your hand
while asking her out. Money and power is the gun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guys, let&amp;#39;s be very careful. However, let&amp;#39;s not forget how to seduce women
and fall in love with them. We have to stay men, especially when
some of those among us are weak abusers deserving no respect.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Yegor Bugayenko</name><email>yegor256@gmail.com</email></author><category term="mood" /><category term="genders" /><summary type="html">You most probably are aware of the recent sexual harassment

&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#equals%28java.lang.Object%29&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Object.equals()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Comparable.html#compareTo%28T%29&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Comparable.compareTo()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
I&amp;#39;ve hated them for years, because, no matter how hard
I try to like them, the code inside looks ugly. Now I know what exactly
is wrong and how I would design this &amp;quot;object-to-object comparing&amp;quot; mechanism
&lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;figure class=&#39;jb_picture&#39;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&#39;image&#39; alt=&#39;L&amp;#39;ultimo capodanno (1998) by Marco Risi&#39; src=&#39;/images/2017/07/lultimo-capodanno.jpg&#39; longdesc=&#39;#4900028f&#39;/&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&#39;4900028f&#39;&gt;L&amp;#39;ultimo capodanno (1998) by Marco Risi&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say we have a &lt;del&gt;simple&lt;/del&gt; primitive class &lt;code&gt;Weight&lt;/code&gt;, objects of which
represent the weight of something in kilos:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Weight&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;kilos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;kilos&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we want two objects of the same weight to be equal to each other:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;equals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is how such a method may look:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Weight&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;kilos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;kilos&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;equals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(!(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;instanceof&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Weight&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;weight&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;cast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;kilos&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;kilos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ugly part here is, first of all, the
&lt;a href=&quot;/2015/04/02/class-casting-is-anti-pattern.html&quot;&gt;type casting&lt;/a&gt;
with &lt;code&gt;instanceof&lt;/code&gt;. The second problem
is that we touch the internals of the incoming object. This design makes
polymorphic behavior of the &lt;code&gt;Weight&lt;/code&gt; impossible. We simply can&amp;#39;t pass
anything else to the &lt;code&gt;equals()&lt;/code&gt; method, besides an instance of the
class &lt;code&gt;Weight&lt;/code&gt;. We can&amp;#39;t turn it into an interface and introduce
multiple implementations of it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Weight&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;equals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This code will not work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;DefaultWeight&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Weight&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// attribute and ctor skipped&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;equals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(!(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;instanceof&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Weight&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;weight&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;cast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;kilos&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;kilos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// error here!&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that one object decides for the other whether they are
equal. This inevitably leads to a necessity to touch private attributes in order
to do the actual comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the solution?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what I&amp;#39;m offering. Any comparison, no matter what types we
are talking about, is about comparing two digital values. Either we
compare a weight with a weight, text with text, or a user with a user&amp;mdash;our
CPUs can only compare numbers. Thus, we introduce a new interface
&lt;code&gt;Digitizable&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Digitizable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;byte&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;digits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we introduce a new class &lt;code&gt;Comparison&lt;/code&gt;, which &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the comparison of
two streams of bytes (I&amp;#39;m not sure the code is perfect, I tested it

  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Comparison&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;byte&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rht&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rht&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;max&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;idx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;lft&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rht&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;signum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we need &lt;code&gt;Weight&lt;/code&gt; to implement &lt;code&gt;Digitizable&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Weight&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Digitizable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;kilos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;kilos&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Override&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;byte&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;digits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ByteBuffer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;allocate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;putInt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;kilos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, this is how we compare them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;v&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Comparison&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;400&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;500&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt; will either be &lt;code&gt;-1&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;. In this particular case it will be &lt;code&gt;-1&lt;/code&gt;,
because &lt;code&gt;400&lt;/code&gt; is less than &lt;code&gt;500&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No more violation of encapsulation, no more type casting, no more
ugly code inside those &lt;code&gt;equals()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;compareTo()&lt;/code&gt; methods.
The class &lt;code&gt;Comparison&lt;/code&gt; will work with all possible types. All our objects
need to do in order to become comparable is to implement &lt;code&gt;Digitizable&lt;/code&gt; and
&amp;quot;provide&amp;quot; their bytes for inspection/comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach is actually very close to the
&lt;a href=&quot;/2016/04/05/printers-instead-of-getters.html&quot;&gt;printers&lt;/a&gt;
I described earlier.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Yegor Bugayenko</name><email>yegor256@gmail.com</email></author><category term="java" /><category term="oop" /><summary type="html">I want to rant a bit about Java design, in particular about the methods

&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.me/joinchat/AAAAAEJFMRzsRTRxM3ec6A&quot;&gt;Telegram group&lt;/a&gt; about &amp;quot;women in tech,&amp;quot;
which led to some negative
&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/delawen/status/880517810400759808&quot;&gt;reaction&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter. I believe I owe my readers
an explanation. Some of them already got confused and came to me with
the question: &amp;quot;If you&amp;#39;re so much against slavery, where is this male
chauvinism coming from?&amp;quot; Let me explain what&amp;#39;s going on. Indeed
I am a big fan of &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html&quot;&gt;freedom&lt;/a&gt;,
but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKcWu0tsiZM&amp;t=1s&quot;&gt;recent hysteria&lt;/a&gt;
around &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_equality&quot;&gt;gender equality&lt;/a&gt;
is not helping us to become more free. Instead it is causing quite
the opposite effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;figure class=&#39;jb_picture&#39;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&#39;image&#39; alt=&#39;Conversations with Other Women (2005) by Hans Canosa&#39; src=&#39;/images/2017/07/conversations-with-other-women.jpg&#39; longdesc=&#39;#ca72484b&#39;/&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&#39;ca72484b&#39;&gt;Conversations with Other Women (2005) by Hans Canosa&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was a kid my parents and my teachers told me that I had to be
a gentleman. That literally meant that I had to treat women with respect
and always remember that they were weaker than us men&amp;mdash;physically
and emotionally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to open the door for them, I was not allowed to fight with them
as I did with my male friends, I was punished for cursing in
front of them, and many other things. I did all this not only because
of what I was taught, but also because I saw that they indeed were weaker. They were
physically and emotionally different from us boys. They played dolls,
we played wars. They wore pink and white skirts and blouses, we wore
shorts and t-shirts. They cried when someone was offending them and
we were supposed to be stronger, never to cry, and to protect them. It was always
obvious that we were the troublemakers, but also the protectors, who those
little creatures eventually one day would marry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it seems that I was raised as a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism&quot;&gt;sexist&lt;/a&gt;.
But do I feel ashamed? Not at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do I believe that gender equality is about making men and women
fully equal in all aspects of life? Not at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be equal, because we are different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many other categories of people in modern societies who
possess special rights or are not allowed to do certain things. Simply put,
they experience
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination&quot;&gt;discrimination&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;em&gt;but for their good&lt;/em&gt;. For example, kids are not allowed to
buy alcohol and watch porn. Senior citizens receive pensions
even though they don&amp;#39;t work any more. People with disabilities
sit in a bus where everybody else is not allowed to. Such &lt;em&gt;inequalities&lt;/em&gt; are only
making us more human. We need them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same is true for the &amp;quot;category&amp;quot; of people I was taught to respect
and protect: women. And no matter what extreme
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism&quot;&gt;feminists&lt;/a&gt; say, I will
remain the same. I do believe in inequality between men and women. I want
to see us as gentlemen and ladies. Not just genderless people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to this inequality men find women attractive, fall in love with them,
marry them and make kids. Thanks to this inequality many years ago my dad asked
my mom out,
&lt;a href=&quot;/2017/07/18/sexual-harassment.html&quot;&gt;kissed her&lt;/a&gt;,
proposed, and brought me into this world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now back to the main problem: women in tech. I&amp;#39;m a programmer myself.
I write and debug code every day. I also manage programmers and projects.
My 20+ years of experience in coding tells me that this job is not fun
most of the time. It&amp;#39;s hard, it requires a lot of
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/dec/02/men-women-brains-wired-differently&quot;&gt;rigid logical thinking&lt;/a&gt;,
it&amp;#39;s rather boring, and it&amp;#39;s a constant war against machines and against other
programmers who produce unmaintainable and unreadable code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t feel good about sending women, who I was raised to protect and respect,
into this war. I also personally don&amp;#39;t like the idea of women being police officers,
soldiers, surgeons, or firefighters, even though it&amp;#39;s not up to me to decide
what they do for a living. Those jobs are stressful and dangerous, both
physically and emotionally. Not that I believe that women can&amp;#39;t take this
stress, I just don&amp;#39;t want them to suffer. There are plenty of gentlemen who can do that
instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do I respect women who write code on a daily basis? Yes, a lot. Because I understand
how much stress they have to go through. Would I recommend my girlfriend do
the same. I don&amp;#39;t think so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I a sexist? Maybe so. But that&amp;#39;s how I was raised.
&lt;del&gt;That&amp;#39;s who I am.&lt;/del&gt; And I&amp;#39;m proud of it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Yegor Bugayenko</name><email>yegor256@gmail.com</email></author><category term="mood" /><category term="genders" /><summary type="html">Recently I said a few words in my

the question: &amp;quot;If you&amp;#39;re so much against slavery, where is this male
chauvinism coming from?&amp;quot; Let me explain what&amp;#39;s going on. Indeed
I am a big fan of freedom,

what I have and even how much I paid for them. Maybe it will be helpful
for someone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/06/env-macbook.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/&quot;&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;
Retina, 15-inch, &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/kb/sp690?locale=en_US&quot;&gt;Late 2013&lt;/a&gt;,
2.3GHz/16Gb/512Gb ($2,900) with MacOS Sierra. I bought it over
three years ago and don&amp;#39;t want to replace with a new one, simply
because &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.devteam.space/new-macbook-pro-is-not-a-laptop-for-developers-anymore-d0d4b1b8b7de&quot;&gt;rumors are&lt;/a&gt;
its quality is very low. My smartphone is
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone6s&quot;&gt;iPhone&amp;nbsp;6s&lt;/a&gt;.
For video and podcast recording I&amp;#39;m using &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2tjPebw&quot;&gt;Zoom&amp;nbsp;H6&lt;/a&gt;
together with
&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2tkdA4G&quot;&gt;Movo LV4-O2&lt;/a&gt; microphone and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2v6YJyD&quot;&gt;Slik Sprint 150&lt;/a&gt; tripod.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/06/env-intellij-idea.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/&quot;&gt;IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;del&gt;$499&lt;/del&gt; free)
for Java projects. I&amp;#39;ve got a free open source
license from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jetbrains.com/&quot;&gt;JetBrains&lt;/a&gt;,
because I&amp;#39;m an active contributor and
an author of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.takes.org&quot;&gt;Takes Framework&lt;/a&gt;.
If you contribute to open source (and
&lt;a href=&quot;/2015/12/22/why-dont-you-contribute-to-open-source.html&quot;&gt;you must&lt;/a&gt;), you may do
the same, I believe, just &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:opensource@jetbrains.com&quot;&gt;email them&lt;/a&gt; and ask.
These are my &lt;a href=&quot;/bin/settings.jar&quot;&gt;settings.jar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/06/env-sublime-text.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sublimetext.com/&quot;&gt;Sublime Text&lt;/a&gt; ($70)
for all texts I edit, including Ruby, JavaScript, and PHP code.
Also, for writing this blog
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256/blog&quot;&gt;in Markdown&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/books.html&quot;&gt;my books&lt;/a&gt; in
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX&quot;&gt;LaTeX&lt;/a&gt; Sublime is the
editor I use. I was using
&lt;a href=&quot;https://macromates.com/&quot;&gt;TextMate&lt;/a&gt; ($52) a few years ago, but switched
to Sublime because it&amp;#39;s just better. I also tried
&lt;a href=&quot;https://atom.io/&quot;&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt; (free) and didn&amp;#39;t really like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/06/env-chrome.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/chrome/index.html&quot;&gt;Chrome&lt;/a&gt; (free)
for web browsing. I also have
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/lae/safari/&quot;&gt;Safari&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/&quot;&gt;FireFox&lt;/a&gt;,
and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opera.com/&quot;&gt;Opera&lt;/a&gt; but only to verify my websites
for cross-browser compatibility, that&amp;#39;s all. I&amp;#39;m using these
plugins:
&lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock/gighmmpiobklfepjocnamgkkbiglidom&quot;&gt;AdBlock&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/block-site/eiimnmioipafcokbfikbljfdeojpcgbh?hl=en&quot;&gt;Block site&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/grammarly-for-chrome/kbfnbcaeplbcioakkpcpgfkobkghlhen?hl=en&quot;&gt;Grammarly&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rapportive/hihakjfhbmlmjdnnhegiciffjplmdhin?hl=en&quot;&gt;Rapportive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/06/env-iterm2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iterm2.com/&quot;&gt;iTerm2&lt;/a&gt; (free)
for the command line. It&amp;#39;s a replacement of
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_%28macOS%29&quot;&gt;Terminal&lt;/a&gt;, with
some nice features, which I&amp;#39;m not actually aware of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/06/env-homebrew.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://brew.sh/&quot;&gt;Homebrew&lt;/a&gt; (free)
for package managing. Difficult to imagine Mac OSX without
Homebrew. I was using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macports.org/&quot;&gt;MacPorts&lt;/a&gt;
in my previous MacBook, but switched to Homebrew and have no regrets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/06/env-yourkit.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yourkit.com/&quot;&gt;YourKit&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;del&gt;$499&lt;/del&gt; free)
for Java profiling. I&amp;#39;ve got a free license from them, again because
I&amp;#39;m a contributor to a few open source projects.
&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:sales@yourkit.com&quot;&gt;Email them&lt;/a&gt;
if you want to get the same. As I
&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/yegor256/status/875444908726730752&quot;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; recently,
when I have to use YourKit, I know that I&amp;#39;m doing something very wrong
in my code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/06/env-httpclient.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/http-client/id418138339?mt=12&quot;&gt;HTTP Client&lt;/a&gt; ($2)
for HTTP requests/responses debugging, when
&lt;a href=&quot;https://curl.haxx.se/&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is not enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/06/env-sketch.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sketchapp.com/&quot;&gt;Sketch&lt;/a&gt; ($99)
for editing vector graphics, mainly SVG. Also, it&amp;#39;s good for
converting SVG into PNG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/06/env-pixelmator.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pixelmator.com/&quot;&gt;Pixelmator&lt;/a&gt; ($30)
for editing rasterized images, like PNG, GIF, JPEG, etc.
The icons you see at this page were created with the help of
Pixelmator. It is a perfect alternative to
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html&quot;&gt;Adobe Photoshop&lt;/a&gt;, if you
are a programmer, not a graphic designer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/06/env-1password.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://1password.com/&quot;&gt;1Password&lt;/a&gt; ($40)
for keeping all my passwords in one place. I don&amp;#39;t know what I would
do without this tool. All my passwords, bank accounts, credit cards,
and passport scans are there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/06/env-zoom.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://zoom.us/&quot;&gt;Zoom&lt;/a&gt; ($150/year)
for conference calling and &lt;a href=&quot;/shift-m.html&quot;&gt;Shift-M&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/06/env-reaper.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://reaper.fm/&quot;&gt;Reaper&lt;/a&gt; ($60)
for post-processing of &lt;a href=&quot;/shift-m.html&quot;&gt;Shift-M&lt;/a&gt; episodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/06/env-things.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://culturedcode.com/things/&quot;&gt;Things&lt;/a&gt; ($50)
for long-term planning. I put my long-term plans there and open
them once a month. I definitely should use this software more frequently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/06/env-tower.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.git-tower.com/&quot;&gt;Tower&lt;/a&gt; ($79)
for visual &lt;a href=&quot;https://git-scm.com/&quot;&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt; manipulations. Even though I&amp;#39;m using Git
from the command line only, this tool helps me time to time when I need
to go through the history and find out where exactly I broke something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/06/env-transmit.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://panic.com/transmit/&quot;&gt;Transmit&lt;/a&gt; ($34)
for FTP and AWS S3 file management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/06/env-obs.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://obsproject.com/&quot;&gt;OBS Studio&lt;/a&gt; (free)
for webinars and video recording.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/06/env-mtorrent.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.utorrent.com/&quot;&gt;µTorrent&lt;/a&gt; (free)
for stealing movies. I find them mostly at
&lt;a href=&quot;http://rutracker.org/forum/index.php&quot;&gt;rutracker.org&lt;/a&gt; or
&lt;a href=&quot;https://piratebay.to/&quot;&gt;The Pirate Bay&lt;/a&gt;.
I do realize that stealing is a bad thing and I&amp;#39;m actually strongly
against piracy, but most movies are either too expensive or not
available for purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/06/env-vlc.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html&quot;&gt;VLC&lt;/a&gt; (free)
for watching those stolen movies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/06/env-vienna.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vienna-rss.com/&quot;&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt; (free)
for reading RSS feeds, rarely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/06/env-istat.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/&quot;&gt;iStat Menus&lt;/a&gt; ($18)
for OSX monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/06/env-keynote.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/06/env-pages.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/06/env-numbers.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/lae/keynote/&quot;&gt;Keynote&lt;/a&gt; for presentations,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/lae/pages/&quot;&gt;Pages&lt;/a&gt; for documents sometimes,
and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/lae/numbers/&quot;&gt;Numbers&lt;/a&gt; for spreadsheets.
I don&amp;#39;t remember me paying for them, but maybe I just forgot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/06/env-dropbox.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/06/env-icloud.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/06/env-google-drive.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/06/env-s3.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/personal&quot;&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt; (free),
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icloud.com/&quot;&gt;iCloud&lt;/a&gt; ($1/mo),
and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/drive/&quot;&gt;Google Drive&lt;/a&gt; for storage.
I try to keep as little as possible on my laptop and upload
everything that is already &amp;quot;history&amp;quot; to my personal
&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/s3/&quot;&gt;AWS S3&lt;/a&gt; bucket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://telegram.org/&quot;&gt;Telegram&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.viber.com/en/&quot;&gt;Viber&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whatsapp.com/&quot;&gt;WhatsApp&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.messenger.com/&quot;&gt;Messenger&lt;/a&gt;, and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.skype.com/en/&quot;&gt;Skype&lt;/a&gt; (all free, in order of preference)
for P2P messaging.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://slack.com/&quot;&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; for business messaging sometimes.
&lt;a href=&quot;http://colloquy.info/&quot;&gt;Colloquy&lt;/a&gt; for IRC messaging when I need it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/06/env-pokerstars.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pokerstars.com/poker/download/?source=13953351&quot;&gt;PokerStars&lt;/a&gt; (not free at all)
for playing poker before falling asleep.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Yegor Bugayenko</name><email>yegor256@gmail.com</email></author><category term="tools" /><summary type="html">I was asked in my Telegram Group
