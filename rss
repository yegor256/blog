a summary of the software and hardware I&amp;#39;m using every day. Now I&amp;#39;ll
list my most favorite websites and online services, which help me do my
daily job: write code and manage projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/07/sites-gmail.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/07/sites-google-calendar.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/07/sites-google-drive.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gmail.com&quot;&gt;Gmail&lt;/a&gt;
is the best email system. It aggregates all my accounts
in one place: all emails are coming to the &lt;code&gt;@gmail.com&lt;/code&gt; address
and I have a few aliases for sending responses.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://calendar.google.com&quot;&gt;Google Calendar&lt;/a&gt; helps me keep my plans in sync,
and &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive&quot;&gt;Google Drive&lt;/a&gt; helps me
share documents with friends sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/07/sites-github.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;
is where we keep our source code repositories. I was also using
&lt;a href=&quot;https://bitbucket.com&quot;&gt;Bitbucket&lt;/a&gt;
a few years ago, but didn&amp;#39;t really like it.
GitHub is simply the best, no doubts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/07/sites-stackoverflow.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/users/187141/yegor256&quot;&gt;StackOverflow&lt;/a&gt;
is where I learn new technologies, ask questions, answer them sometimes
and really enjoy working with the community. When I have some free time
I just search by
&lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/design-patterns&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;design-patterns&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; or
&lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/oop&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;oop&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;
tags in order to find relevant questions and answer them if I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.wring.io/images/logo.svg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wring.io&quot;&gt;Wring&lt;/a&gt; aggregates my GitHub notifications
and helps me stay on top of all events that are happening there.
It&amp;#39;s my own project and I use it every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/07/sites-rultor.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rultor.com&quot;&gt;Rultor&lt;/a&gt; is helping me
&lt;a href=&quot;/2014/07/24/rultor-automated-merging.html&quot;&gt;merge&lt;/a&gt; pull requests,
&lt;a href=&quot;/2014/09/11/deployment-script-vs-rultor.html&quot;&gt;deploy&lt;/a&gt; my projects to production and
&lt;a href=&quot;/2014/08/19/how-to-release-to-maven-central.html&quot;&gt;release&lt;/a&gt;
their new versions. It&amp;#39;s one of my
&lt;a href=&quot;/pets.html&quot;&gt;pet projects&lt;/a&gt; and I&amp;#39;m using it every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/07/sites-travis-ci.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/07/sites-shippable.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://travis-ci.org&quot;&gt;Travis&lt;/a&gt; for open source and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://shippable.com&quot;&gt;Shippable&lt;/a&gt; for commercial projects, as
continuous integration platforms. There are
&lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/05/ten-hosted-continuous-integration-services.html&quot;&gt;many alternatives&lt;/a&gt;,
but I like these guys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/07/sites-godaddy.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.godaddy.com&quot;&gt;Godaddy&lt;/a&gt; is where I register all domain
names. Their user interface is terrible, but their
prices are the lowest. So, I&amp;#39;m with them for at least eight years already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/07/sites-google-analytics.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/07/sites-google-webmasters.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://analytics.google.com&quot;&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home&quot;&gt;Google Webmasters&lt;/a&gt;
are two systems where I track
my entire web traffic of all my websites. Both systems are terrible, performance
and interface wise. But since it&amp;#39;s Google, we have to stay with them,
to see how they understand web statistics. I&amp;#39;m also using
&lt;a href=&quot;https://hit.ua&quot;&gt;hit.ua&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/07/sites-hacker-news.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/07/sites-reddit.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/&quot;&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/&quot;&gt;/r/programming&lt;/a&gt; at Reddit
seem to be the best sources of news for me. I open them a few times a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/07/sites-facebook.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/07/sites-twitter.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;
are the social networks I&amp;#39;m spamming regularly. They are far from being
perfect, but they totally dominate the market.
I was using these guys, but they seem to be &lt;del&gt;dead&lt;/del&gt; less popular now:
LinkedIn, Google+.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/07/sites-amazon.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2ufwBbw&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;
is where I buy everything that is not food or clothes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/07/sites-aws.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/&quot;&gt;AWS&lt;/a&gt;
is where I keep all
&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/s3/&quot;&gt;my data&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/route53/&quot;&gt;my DNS&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/&quot;&gt;my servers&lt;/a&gt;,
and some other things. I&amp;#39;m with them since they
launched S3 (in 2006).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/07/sites-contabo.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://contabo.com/&quot;&gt;Contabo&lt;/a&gt;
is where I host servers, which I need 24x7. Their prices are great
and the service is pretty decent. I&amp;#39;m with them for at least five years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/07/sites-papertrail.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://papertrailapp.com/?thank=9e5dc6&quot;&gt;Papertrail&lt;/a&gt;
is where all my logs are being aggregated. I tried a few other
systems, but these guys seem to be the best. I even was paying them something
some time ago, but stopped&amp;mdash;their free package seems to be sufficient
enough for my volumes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/07/sites-sentry.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sentry.io&quot;&gt;Sentry&lt;/a&gt;
is where all my errors are being sent to, from production systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/07/sites-buffer.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buffer.com&quot;&gt;Buffer&lt;/a&gt;
is helping me to spam Twitter and Facebook more effectively. I pay
them for the premium package and have no regrets. The service really
helps me deliver content to the social networks on schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/07/sites-youtube.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;
is where I keep my video content. I also stream
&lt;a href=&quot;/webinars.html&quot;&gt;my webinars&lt;/a&gt; there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/07/sites-soundcloud.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soundcloud.com&quot;&gt;SoundCloud&lt;/a&gt;
is where I&amp;#39;m listening to music and keep my own channel with
&lt;a href=&quot;/shift-m.html&quot;&gt;Shift-M&lt;/a&gt; podcast and other audio content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/07/sites-quickbooks.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://qdc.qbo.intuit.com/qbo30/login&quot;&gt;QuickBooks&lt;/a&gt;
is where I keep all my bookkeeping accounts, for all my companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/30/technology/women-entrepreneurs-speak-out-sexual-harassment.html?_r=0&quot;&gt;scandals&lt;/a&gt;
in Silicon Valley, which led to serious career problems for
&lt;a href=&quot;https://500hats.com/im-a-creep-i-m-sorry-d2c13e996ea0&quot;&gt;Dave McClure&lt;/a&gt; (former CEO of &lt;a href=&quot;https://500.co/&quot;&gt;500 Startups&lt;/a&gt;),

Let&amp;#39;s try to put emotions aside and analyze what&amp;#39;s happening
and what long-term consequences this panic may have for our
male-dominated engineering environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;figure class=&#39;jb_picture&#39;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&#39;image&#39; alt=&#39;Twentynine Palms (2003) by Bruno Dumont&#39; src=&#39;/images/2017/07/twentynine-palms.jpg&#39; longdesc=&#39;#c014ddd9&#39;/&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&#39;c014ddd9&#39;&gt;Twentynine Palms (2003) by Bruno Dumont&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will never know what really happened between those male investors and
female entrepreneurs behind closed doors, but the gist of the accusation
is that the former were &lt;em&gt;making advances&lt;/em&gt; towards the latter,
where it was clearly &lt;em&gt;inappropriate&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does that mean exactly? What, for example, did Dave McClure do in order
to be kicked out of the company he founded?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s see. According to Katie Benner from The New York Times,
he sent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/30/technology/women-entrepreneurs-speak-out-sexual-harassment.html&quot;&gt;this message&lt;/a&gt;
to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sarahkunst&quot;&gt;Sarah Kunst&lt;/a&gt;,
who was an applicant at his incubator in 2014 (other &amp;quot;harassers&amp;quot; were accused of
doing something very similar):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was getting confused figuring out whether to hire you or hit on you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously he was flirting. And what&amp;#39;s wrong with that? Can&amp;#39;t we flirt any more?
Is it a crime all of a sudden? One thing is wrong though. It was a &lt;em&gt;threat&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though this message didn&amp;#39;t say it explicitly, it actually &lt;em&gt;implied&lt;/em&gt;
that &amp;quot;you either go along and we go out, or you won&amp;#39;t be hired.&amp;quot; Of course,
&amp;quot;no hire&amp;quot; may not hurt as much as a knife or a fist in the face, but it
does hurt. Especially if you are a woman, a member of a minority group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a &lt;del&gt;sexist&lt;/del&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/07/04/sexism.html&quot;&gt;gentleman&lt;/a&gt;,
I feel bad when I see women being threatened. I want to protect them
and I expect our system of justice to help me, just
like it helps when we deal with physical violence.
These threats or attempts to threaten must be punished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is nothing wrong with the game between the sexes by itself. Just
like we don&amp;#39;t prohibit sex because we are afraid of rapists, we must not
stop asking women out because of our fear of a possible harassment accusation.
However, it seems that this is what is happening now: men are becoming &lt;em&gt;afraid&lt;/em&gt; of women.
Especially powerful men with money and status. They realize
that a small incautious step may help them become the next Dave or Travis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fear is destroying us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to this fear our &lt;em&gt;masculine&lt;/em&gt; characteristics become a victim of this dangerous game
that society is playing right now, with a noble intent to protect women against
verbal and psychological abuse. We men are losing our self-confidence,
our self-esteem, our &lt;del&gt;balls&lt;/del&gt; courage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fear mentally castrates us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must be absolutely clear that those harassers are guilty not because
they &amp;quot;made advances&amp;quot; towards women who work with them or for them, but because
they were &lt;em&gt;threatening&lt;/em&gt; those ladies. There is nothing wrong in being
attracted to a woman, no matter who she is: your boss, your employee, your
schoolmate, or the founder of the business you&amp;#39;re investing in. Moreover,
there is nothing wrong in making advances, falling in love, having sex
and marrying them. Threatening them in order to get all that is very wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not every flirtation is harassment. Not every man with a sexual
instinct is a rapist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How would I re-phrase that message to Sarah if I had been Dave and had fallen
in love with her at first sight? I would probably say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was getting confused, figuring out how to isolate my hiring process
from my desire to hit on you. How about dinner? I promise,
no matter how it ends, it will not affect our hiring decision at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realize that it&amp;#39;s not perfect, since she wouldn&amp;#39;t be completely
comfortable, and still might expect Dave&amp;#39;s feelings to affect his hiring decision
if it turns out she doesn&amp;#39;t like him or simply already has a partner. However,
this would seem like a respectful attempt to put the weapon down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to not threaten a woman if you&amp;#39;re holding a gun in your hand
while asking her out. Money and power is the gun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guys, let&amp;#39;s be very careful. However, let&amp;#39;s not forget how to seduce women
and fall in love with them. We have to stay men, especially when
some of those among us are weak abusers deserving no respect.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Yegor Bugayenko</name><email>yegor256@gmail.com</email></author><category term="mood" /><category term="genders" /><summary type="html">You most probably are aware of the recent sexual harassment

&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#equals%28java.lang.Object%29&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Object.equals()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

I&amp;#39;ve hated them for years, because, no matter how hard
I try to like them, the code inside looks ugly. Now I know what exactly
is wrong and how I would design this &amp;quot;object-to-object comparing&amp;quot; mechanism
&lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;figure class=&#39;jb_picture&#39;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&#39;image&#39; alt=&#39;L&amp;#39;ultimo capodanno (1998) by Marco Risi&#39; src=&#39;/images/2017/07/lultimo-capodanno.jpg&#39; longdesc=&#39;#4900028f&#39;/&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&#39;4900028f&#39;&gt;L&amp;#39;ultimo capodanno (1998) by Marco Risi&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say we have a &lt;del&gt;simple&lt;/del&gt; primitive class &lt;code&gt;Weight&lt;/code&gt;, objects of which
represent the weight of something in kilos:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Weight&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;kilos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;kilos&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we want two objects of the same weight to be equal to each other:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;equals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is how such a method may look:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Weight&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;kilos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;kilos&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;equals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(!(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;instanceof&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Weight&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;weight&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;cast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;kilos&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;kilos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ugly part here is, first of all, the
&lt;a href=&quot;/2015/04/02/class-casting-is-anti-pattern.html&quot;&gt;type casting&lt;/a&gt;
with &lt;code&gt;instanceof&lt;/code&gt;. The second problem
is that we touch the internals of the incoming object. This design makes
polymorphic behavior of the &lt;code&gt;Weight&lt;/code&gt; impossible. We simply can&amp;#39;t pass
anything else to the &lt;code&gt;equals()&lt;/code&gt; method, besides an instance of the
class &lt;code&gt;Weight&lt;/code&gt;. We can&amp;#39;t turn it into an interface and introduce
multiple implementations of it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Weight&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;equals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This code will not work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;DefaultWeight&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Weight&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// attribute and ctor skipped&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;equals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(!(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;instanceof&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Weight&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;weight&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;cast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;kilos&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;kilos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// error here!&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that one object decides for the other whether they are
equal. This inevitably leads to a necessity to touch private attributes in order
to do the actual comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the solution?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what I&amp;#39;m offering. Any comparison, no matter what types we
are talking about, is about comparing two digital values. Either we
compare a weight with a weight, text with text, or a user with a user&amp;mdash;our
CPUs can only compare numbers. Thus, we introduce a new interface
&lt;code&gt;Digitizable&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Digitizable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;byte&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;digits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we introduce a new class &lt;code&gt;Comparison&lt;/code&gt;, which &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the comparison of
two streams of bytes (I&amp;#39;m not sure the code is perfect, I tested it
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256/blog/tree/master/_samples/2017/07/equals&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;,

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Comparison&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Digitizable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;lt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;idx&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;max&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;idx&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;idx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;byte&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;lft&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;idx&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;byte&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rht&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rht&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;max&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;idx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;lft&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rht&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;signum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we need &lt;code&gt;Weight&lt;/code&gt; to implement &lt;code&gt;Digitizable&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Weight&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Digitizable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;kilos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;kilos&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;@Override&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;byte&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;digits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ByteBuffer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;allocate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;putInt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;kilos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, this is how we compare them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;v&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Comparison&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;400&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;500&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt; will either be &lt;code&gt;-1&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;. In this particular case it will be &lt;code&gt;-1&lt;/code&gt;,
because &lt;code&gt;400&lt;/code&gt; is less than &lt;code&gt;500&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No more violation of encapsulation, no more type casting, no more
ugly code inside those &lt;code&gt;equals()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;compareTo()&lt;/code&gt; methods.
The class &lt;code&gt;Comparison&lt;/code&gt; will work with all possible types. All our objects
need to do in order to become comparable is to implement &lt;code&gt;Digitizable&lt;/code&gt; and
&amp;quot;provide&amp;quot; their bytes for inspection/comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach is actually very close to the
&lt;a href=&quot;/2016/04/05/printers-instead-of-getters.html&quot;&gt;printers&lt;/a&gt;
I described earlier.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Yegor Bugayenko</name><email>yegor256@gmail.com</email></author><category term="java" /><category term="oop" /><summary type="html">I want to rant a bit about Java design, in particular about the methods

&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.me/joinchat/AAAAAEJFMRzsRTRxM3ec6A&quot;&gt;Telegram group&lt;/a&gt; about &amp;quot;women in tech,&amp;quot;
which led to some negative
&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/delawen/status/880517810400759808&quot;&gt;reaction&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter. I believe I owe my readers
an explanation. Some of them already got confused and came to me with
the question: &amp;quot;If you&amp;#39;re so much against slavery, where is this male
chauvinism coming from?&amp;quot; Let me explain what&amp;#39;s going on. Indeed
I am a big fan of &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html&quot;&gt;freedom&lt;/a&gt;,
but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKcWu0tsiZM&amp;t=1s&quot;&gt;recent hysteria&lt;/a&gt;
around &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_equality&quot;&gt;gender equality&lt;/a&gt;
is not helping us to become more free. Instead it is causing quite
the opposite effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;figure class=&#39;jb_picture&#39;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&#39;image&#39; alt=&#39;Conversations with Other Women (2005) by Hans Canosa&#39; src=&#39;/images/2017/07/conversations-with-other-women.jpg&#39; longdesc=&#39;#ca72484b&#39;/&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&#39;ca72484b&#39;&gt;Conversations with Other Women (2005) by Hans Canosa&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was a kid my parents and my teachers told me that I had to be
a gentleman. That literally meant that I had to treat women with respect
and always remember that they were weaker than us men&amp;mdash;physically
and emotionally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to open the door for them, I was not allowed to fight with them
as I did with my male friends, I was punished for cursing in
front of them, and many other things. I did all this not only because
of what I was taught, but also because I saw that they indeed were weaker. They were
physically and emotionally different from us boys. They played dolls,
we played wars. They wore pink and white skirts and blouses, we wore
shorts and t-shirts. They cried when someone was offending them and
we were supposed to be stronger, never to cry, and to protect them. It was always
obvious that we were the troublemakers, but also the protectors, who those
little creatures eventually one day would marry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it seems that I was raised as a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism&quot;&gt;sexist&lt;/a&gt;.
But do I feel ashamed? Not at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do I believe that gender equality is about making men and women
fully equal in all aspects of life? Not at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be equal, because we are different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many other categories of people in modern societies who
possess special rights or are not allowed to do certain things. Simply put,
they experience
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination&quot;&gt;discrimination&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;em&gt;but for their good&lt;/em&gt;. For example, kids are not allowed to
buy alcohol and watch porn. Senior citizens receive pensions
even though they don&amp;#39;t work any more. People with disabilities
sit in a bus where everybody else is not allowed to. Such &lt;em&gt;inequalities&lt;/em&gt; are only
making us more human. We need them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same is true for the &amp;quot;category&amp;quot; of people I was taught to respect
and protect: women. And no matter what extreme
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism&quot;&gt;feminists&lt;/a&gt; say, I will
remain the same. I do believe in inequality between men and women. I want
to see us as gentlemen and ladies. Not just genderless people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to this inequality men find women attractive, fall in love with them,
marry them and make kids. Thanks to this inequality many years ago my dad asked
my mom out,
&lt;a href=&quot;/2017/07/18/sexual-harassment.html&quot;&gt;kissed her&lt;/a&gt;,
proposed, and brought me into this world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now back to the main problem: women in tech. I&amp;#39;m a programmer myself.
I write and debug code every day. I also manage programmers and projects.
My 20+ years of experience in coding tells me that this job is not fun
most of the time. It&amp;#39;s hard, it requires a lot of
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/dec/02/men-women-brains-wired-differently&quot;&gt;rigid logical thinking&lt;/a&gt;,
it&amp;#39;s rather boring, and it&amp;#39;s a constant war against machines and against other
programmers who produce unmaintainable and unreadable code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t feel good about sending women, who I was raised to protect and respect,
into this war. I also personally don&amp;#39;t like the idea of women being police officers,
soldiers, surgeons, or firefighters, even though it&amp;#39;s not up to me to decide
what they do for a living. Those jobs are stressful and dangerous, both
physically and emotionally. Not that I believe that women can&amp;#39;t take this
stress, I just don&amp;#39;t want them to suffer. There are plenty of gentlemen who can do that
instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do I respect women who write code on a daily basis? Yes, a lot. Because I understand
how much stress they have to go through. Would I recommend my girlfriend do
the same. I don&amp;#39;t think so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I a sexist? Maybe so. But that&amp;#39;s how I was raised.
&lt;del&gt;That&amp;#39;s who I am.&lt;/del&gt; And I&amp;#39;m proud of it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Yegor Bugayenko</name><email>yegor256@gmail.com</email></author><category term="mood" /><category term="genders" /><summary type="html">Recently I said a few words in my

which tools and hardware I use in my daily work. Here is the full list of
what I have and even how much I paid for them. Maybe it will be helpful
for someone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/06/env-macbook.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/&quot;&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;
Retina, 15-inch, &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/kb/sp690?locale=en_US&quot;&gt;Late 2013&lt;/a&gt;,
2.3GHz/16Gb/512Gb ($2,900) with MacOS Sierra. I bought it over
three years ago and don&amp;#39;t want to replace with a new one, simply
because &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.devteam.space/new-macbook-pro-is-not-a-laptop-for-developers-anymore-d0d4b1b8b7de&quot;&gt;rumors are&lt;/a&gt;
its quality is very low. My smartphone is
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone6s&quot;&gt;iPhone&amp;nbsp;6s&lt;/a&gt;.
For podcast recording I&amp;#39;m using &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2tjPebw&quot;&gt;Zoom&amp;nbsp;H6&lt;/a&gt;
together with
&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2tkdA4G&quot;&gt;Movo LV4-O2&lt;/a&gt; microphone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/06/env-intellij-idea.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/&quot;&gt;IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;del&gt;$499&lt;/del&gt; free)
for Java projects. I&amp;#39;ve got a free open source
license from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jetbrains.com/&quot;&gt;JetBrains&lt;/a&gt;,
because I&amp;#39;m an active contributor and
an author of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.takes.org&quot;&gt;Takes Framework&lt;/a&gt;.
If you contribute to open source (and
&lt;a href=&quot;/2015/12/22/why-dont-you-contribute-to-open-source.html&quot;&gt;you must&lt;/a&gt;), you may do
the same, I believe, just &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:opensource@jetbrains.com&quot;&gt;email them&lt;/a&gt; and ask.
These are my &lt;a href=&quot;/bin/settings.jar&quot;&gt;settings.jar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/06/env-sublime-text.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sublimetext.com/&quot;&gt;Sublime Text&lt;/a&gt; ($70)
for all texts I edit, including Ruby, JavaScript, and PHP code.
Also, for writing this blog
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256/blog&quot;&gt;in Markdown&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/books.html&quot;&gt;my books&lt;/a&gt; in
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX&quot;&gt;LaTeX&lt;/a&gt; Sublime is the
editor I use. I was using
&lt;a href=&quot;https://macromates.com/&quot;&gt;TextMate&lt;/a&gt; ($52) a few years ago, but switched
to Sublime because it&amp;#39;s just better. I also tried
&lt;a href=&quot;https://atom.io/&quot;&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt; (free) and didn&amp;#39;t really like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/06/env-chrome.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/chrome/index.html&quot;&gt;Chrome&lt;/a&gt; (free)
for web browsing. I also have
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/lae/safari/&quot;&gt;Safari&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/&quot;&gt;FireFox&lt;/a&gt;,
and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opera.com/&quot;&gt;Opera&lt;/a&gt; but only to verify my websites
for cross-browser compatibility, that&amp;#39;s all. I&amp;#39;m using these
plugins:
&lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock/gighmmpiobklfepjocnamgkkbiglidom&quot;&gt;AdBlock&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/block-site/eiimnmioipafcokbfikbljfdeojpcgbh?hl=en&quot;&gt;Block site&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/grammarly-for-chrome/kbfnbcaeplbcioakkpcpgfkobkghlhen?hl=en&quot;&gt;Grammarly&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rapportive/hihakjfhbmlmjdnnhegiciffjplmdhin?hl=en&quot;&gt;Rapportive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/06/env-iterm2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iterm2.com/&quot;&gt;iTerm2&lt;/a&gt; (free)
for the command line. It&amp;#39;s a replacement of
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_%28macOS%29&quot;&gt;Terminal&lt;/a&gt;, with
some nice features, which I&amp;#39;m not actually aware of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/06/env-homebrew.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://brew.sh/&quot;&gt;Homebrew&lt;/a&gt; (free)
for package managing. Difficult to imagine Mac OSX without
Homebrew. I was using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macports.org/&quot;&gt;MacPorts&lt;/a&gt;
in my previous MacBook, but switched to Homebrew and have no regrets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/06/env-yourkit.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yourkit.com/&quot;&gt;YourKit&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;del&gt;$499&lt;/del&gt; free)
for Java profiling. I&amp;#39;ve got a free license from them, again because
I&amp;#39;m a contributor to a few open source projects.
&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:sales@yourkit.com&quot;&gt;Email them&lt;/a&gt;
if you want to get the same. As I
&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/yegor256/status/875444908726730752&quot;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; recently,
when I have to use YourKit, I know that I&amp;#39;m doing something very wrong
in my code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/06/env-httpclient.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/http-client/id418138339?mt=12&quot;&gt;HTTP Client&lt;/a&gt; ($2)
for HTTP requests/responses debugging, when
&lt;a href=&quot;https://curl.haxx.se/&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is not enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/06/env-sketch.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sketchapp.com/&quot;&gt;Sketch&lt;/a&gt; ($99)
for editing vector graphics, mainly SVG. Also, it&amp;#39;s good for
converting SVG into PNG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/06/env-pixelmator.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pixelmator.com/&quot;&gt;Pixelmator&lt;/a&gt; ($30)
for editing rasterized images, like PNG, GIF, JPEG, etc.
The icons you see at this page were created with the help of
Pixelmator. It is a perfect alternative to
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html&quot;&gt;Adobe Photoshop&lt;/a&gt;, if you
are a programmer, not a graphic designer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/06/env-1password.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://1password.com/&quot;&gt;1Password&lt;/a&gt; ($40)
for keeping all my passwords in one place. I don&amp;#39;t know what I would
do without this tool. All my passwords, bank accounts, credit cards,
and passport scans are there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/06/env-zoom.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://zoom.us/&quot;&gt;Zoom&lt;/a&gt; ($150/year)
for conference calling and &lt;a href=&quot;/shift-m.html&quot;&gt;Shift-M&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2017/06/env-reaper.jpg&quot; class=&quot;env-ico&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

available for purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cactoos.org&quot;&gt;Cactoos&lt;/a&gt; is a library of object-oriented
Java primitives
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256/cactoos#contributors&quot;&gt;we&lt;/a&gt;
started to work on just a few weeks ago. The intent was to
propose a clean and more declarative alternative to
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Development_Kit&quot;&gt;JDK&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google/guava&quot;&gt;Guava&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.apache.org/&quot;&gt;Apache Commons&lt;/a&gt;,
and others. Instead of calling static
&lt;a href=&quot;/2014/05/05/oop-alternative-to-utility-classes.html&quot;&gt;procedures&lt;/a&gt;
we want to use &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/07/14/who-is-object.html&quot;&gt;objects&lt;/a&gt;,
the way they are supposed to be used. Let&amp;#39;s see how input/output works in a &lt;em&gt;pure&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/2016/08/15/what-is-wrong-object-oriented-programming.html&quot;&gt;object-oriented&lt;/a&gt;
fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/strong&gt;: The version I&amp;#39;m using at the time of writing is
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256/cactoos/releases/tag/0.9&quot;&gt;0.9&lt;/a&gt;. Later versions
may have different names of classes and a totally different design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s say you want to read a file. This is how you would do it with the static method
&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/Files.html#readAllBytes%28java.nio.file.Path%29&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;readAllBytes()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from the
&lt;a href=&quot;/2014/05/05/oop-alternative-to-utility-classes.html&quot;&gt;utility class&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/Files.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Files&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
in JDK7:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;byte&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;content&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Files&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;readAllBytes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;File&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;/tmp/photo.jpg&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;toPath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This code is very imperative&amp;mdash;it reads the file content right here and now,
placing it into the array.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how you do it with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256/cactoos&quot;&gt;Cactoos&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Bytes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;InputAsBytes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;FileAsInput&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;File&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;/tmp/photo.jpg&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pay attention&amp;mdash;there are no method calls yet. Just three constructors
of three classes that compose a bigger object. The object &lt;code&gt;source&lt;/code&gt; is of type
&lt;a href=&quot;http://static.javadoc.io/org.cactoos/cactoos/0.9/org/cactoos/Bytes.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Bytes&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
and represents the content of the file. To get that content
out of it we call its method &lt;code&gt;asBytes()&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;bytes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;content&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;asBytes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the moment when the file system is touched. This approach, as you
can see, is absolutely declarative and thanks to that possesses all the
benefits of object orientation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is another example. Say you want to write some text into a file. Here
is how you do it in Cactoos. First you need the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://static.javadoc.io/org.cactoos/cactoos/0.9/org/cactoos/Input.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Input&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;BytesAsInput&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;TextAsBytes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;StringAsText&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Hello, world!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you need the &lt;a href=&quot;http://static.javadoc.io/org.cactoos/cactoos/0.9/org/cactoos/Output.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Output&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Output&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;output&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;FileAsOutput&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;File&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;/tmp/hello.txt&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we want to copy the input to the output. There is no &amp;quot;copy&amp;quot; operation
in &lt;em&gt;pure&lt;/em&gt; OOP. Moreover, there must be no operations at all. Just objects. We
have a class named
&lt;a href=&quot;http://static.javadoc.io/org.cactoos/cactoos/0.9/org/cactoos/io/TeeInput.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;TeeInput&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
which is an &lt;code&gt;Input&lt;/code&gt; that copies everything
you read from it to the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://static.javadoc.io/org.cactoos/cactoos/0.9/org/cactoos/Output.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Output&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
similar to what
&lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-io/javadocs/api-1.4/org/apache/commons/io/input/TeeInputStream.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;TeeInputStream&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
from &lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.apache.org/&quot;&gt;Apache Commons&lt;/a&gt; does, but encapsulated. So we don&amp;#39;t copy, we create an
&lt;a href=&quot;http://static.javadoc.io/org.cactoos/cactoos/0.9/org/cactoos/Input.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Input&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
that will copy if you &lt;em&gt;touch&lt;/em&gt; it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tee&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;TeeInput&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;output&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we have to &amp;quot;touch&amp;quot; it. And we have to touch every single byte of it,
in order to make sure they all are copied. If we just &lt;code&gt;read()&lt;/code&gt; the first
byte, only one byte will be copied to the file. The best way to touch them
all is to calculate the size of the &lt;code&gt;tee&lt;/code&gt; object, going byte by byte. We
have an object for it, called
&lt;a href=&quot;http://static.javadoc.io/org.cactoos/cactoos/0.9/org/cactoos/io/LengthOfInput.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;LengthOfInput&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
It encapsulates an
&lt;a href=&quot;http://static.javadoc.io/org.cactoos/cactoos/0.9/org/cactoos/Input.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Input&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
and behaves like its length in bytes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Scalar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Long&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;LengthOfInput&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we take the value out of it and the file writing operation takes place:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;long&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;len&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, the entire operation of writing the string to the file will
look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;LengthOfInput&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;TeeInput&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;BytesAsInput&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;TextAsBytes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;StringAsText&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Hello, world!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;FileAsOutput&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;File&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;/tmp/hello.txt&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// happens here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is its procedural alternative from
&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/Files.html#write%28java.nio.file.Path,%20byte%5B%5D,%20java.nio.file.OpenOption...%29&quot;&gt;JDK7&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Files&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;File&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;/tmp/hello.txt&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;toPath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Hello, world!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;getBytes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why is object-oriented better, even though it&amp;#39;s longer?&amp;quot; I hear you ask.
Because it perfectly &lt;strong&gt;decouples&lt;/strong&gt; concepts, while the procedural one keeps
them together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s say, you are designing a class that is supposed
to encrypt some text and save it to a file. Here is how you would
design it the procedural way (not a real encryption, of course):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Encoder&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;File&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Encoder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;File&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;target&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;encode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Files&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;replaceAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;[a-z]&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;*&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Works fine, but what will happen when you decide to extend it to also write to
an &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/OutputStream.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;OutputStream&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;?
How will you modify this class? How ugly will it look after that?
That&amp;#39;s because the design is not object-oriented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how you would do the same design, in an object-oriented way,
with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cactoos.org&quot;&gt;Cactoos&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Encoder&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Output&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Encoder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;File&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;FileAsOutput&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Encoder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Output&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;output&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;target&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;output&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;encode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;LengthOfInput&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;TeeInput&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;BytesAsInput&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;TextAsBytes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;StringAsText&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;replaceAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;[a-z]&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;*&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do we do with this design if we want
&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/OutputStream.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;OutputStream&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
to be accepted? We just add one
&lt;a href=&quot;/2015/05/28/one-primary-constructor.html&quot;&gt;secondary&lt;/a&gt; constructor:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Encoder&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Encoder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;OutputStream&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;stream&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;OutputStreamAsOutput&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;stream&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Done. That&amp;#39;s how easy and elegant it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s because concepts are perfectly separated and functionality
is encapsulated. In the procedural example the behavior of the object is
located outside of it, in the method &lt;code&gt;encode()&lt;/code&gt;. The file itself doesn&amp;#39;t know
how to write, some outside procedure
&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/Files.html#write%28java.nio.file.Path,%20byte%5B%5D,%20java.nio.file.OpenOption...%29&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Files.write()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
knows that instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the contrary, in the object-oriented design the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://static.javadoc.io/org.cactoos/cactoos/0.9/org/cactoos/io/FileAsOutput.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;FileAsOutput&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
knows how to write, and nobody else does.
The file writing functionality is encapsulated and this makes it
possible to decorate the objects in any possible way, creating
reusable and replaceable composite objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;/2017/04/25/sixnines.html&quot;&gt;SixNines.io&lt;/a&gt;,
one of my Ruby pet web apps, I&amp;#39;m using
&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/&quot;&gt;DynamoDB&lt;/a&gt;, a NoSQL cloud database
by &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/&quot;&gt;AWS&lt;/a&gt;. It works like a charm, but the problem
is that it&amp;#39;s not so easy to create an integration test, to make sure
my code works together with the &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; DynamoDB server and tables. Let me
show you how it was solved. The code is open source and you can see it
in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256/sixnines&quot;&gt;yegor256/sixnines&lt;/a&gt; GitHub repo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-bootstrap-dynamodb-local&quot;&gt;How to bootstrap DynamoDB Local&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, you need to use
&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/dynamodb-local-for-desktop-development/&quot;&gt;DynamoDB Local&lt;/a&gt;,
a command line tool created by AWS exactly for the
purposes of testing. You need to start it before your integration
tests and stop it afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make things simpler
I suggest you use &lt;a href=&quot;http://dynamodb.jcabi.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;jcabi-dynamodb-maven-plugin&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
a &lt;a href=&quot;https://maven.apache.org/&quot;&gt;Maven&lt;/a&gt; plugin that I
&lt;a href=&quot;/2014/05/01/dynamodb-local-maven-plugin.html&quot;&gt;made&lt;/a&gt; a few years ago.
You will need to add
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256/sixnines/blob/0.17/dynamodb-local/pom.xml&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;pom.xml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to your
repository and start/stop Maven from a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256/sixnines/blob/0.17/Rakefile&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Rakefile&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
just like I&amp;#39;m doing &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256/sixnines/blob/0.17/Rakefile#L50-L67&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;retry&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I&amp;#39;m removing &lt;code&gt;dynamodb-local/target&lt;/code&gt;, the directory where Maven keeps
its temporary files, to make sure we always start from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, I&amp;#39;m starting &lt;code&gt;mvn install&lt;/code&gt;, using &lt;code&gt;Process.spawn&lt;/code&gt;, as a background
process with &lt;code&gt;pid&lt;/code&gt; as its process ID (this won&amp;#39;t work in Windows, only Linux/Mac).
Then I immediately register an
&lt;a href=&quot;https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.3/Kernel.html#method-i-at_exit&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;at_exit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Ruby hook, which will be executed if Ruby dies for any reason. I&amp;#39;m sure
it&amp;#39;s obvious why I have to do that&amp;mdash;in order to avoid garbage running
in the background after Rake is finished or terminated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pay attention, I&amp;#39;m using &lt;code&gt;kill -TERM&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;kill -KILL&lt;/code&gt;, in order to
give Maven a chance to wrap everything up, terminate DynamoDB Local correctly,
close its TCP port and exit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-check-that-its-running&quot;&gt;How to check that it&amp;#39;s running&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next I&amp;#39;m checking the status of &lt;code&gt;sn-endpoints&lt;/code&gt;, one of the tables in the
DynamoDB Local. It has to be there if the server is up and running. It will
be created by &lt;code&gt;jcabi-dynamodb-maven-plugin&lt;/code&gt; according to
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256/sixnines/blob/0.17/dynamodb-local/tables/sn-endpoints.json&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sn-endpoints.json&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
its JSON configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most probably the table won&amp;#39;t be ready immediately though, since it takes time to
bootstrap Maven, start the server, and create tables there. That&amp;#39;s why, if the
exception is thrown, I catch it, wait for 5 seconds and try again.
I keep trying many times, until the server is ready. Eventually it will be.
It takes about 12-15 seconds on my MacBook, which means 2-3 attempts/exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-connect-to-dynamodb-local&quot;&gt;How to connect to DynamoDB Local&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My classes need to know how to connect to the server during integration tests.
In production they need to connect to AWS, in testing they have to
know about the DynamoDB Local instance I just started. This is what I have in my class
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256/sixnines/blob/0.17/objects/dynamo.rb&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Dynamo&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
which is responsible for the very connection with DynamoDB. Its decision
on where to connect is based on the environment variable &lt;code&gt;RACK_ENV&lt;/code&gt;, which
is set to &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;test&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; in
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256/sixnines/blob/0.17/test/test__helper.rb#L25&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;test__helper.rb&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
which is included by
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256/sixnines/blob/0.17/Rakefile#L39&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;rake/testtask&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
in front of all other tests, thanks to the double underscore in its name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the environment variable is set to &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;test&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;code&gt;Dynamo&lt;/code&gt; takes the connectivity parameters from the YAML file
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256/sixnines/blob/0.17/objects/dynamo.rb#L37&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;dynamodb-local/target/dynamo.yml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
created by
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256/sixnines/blob/0.17/dynamodb-local/pom.xml#L79-L100&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;maven-resources-plugin:copy-resources&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
The TCP port of the DynamoDB Local database will be
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256/sixnines/blob/0.17/dynamodb-local/config/dynamo.yml&quot;&gt;there&lt;/a&gt;,
as well as the DynamoDB authentication key and secret.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-run-the-integration-tests&quot;&gt;How to run the integration tests&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the easiest part. I just use my objects the way they are supposed
to be used in production and they connect to DynamoDB Local instead of AWS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m using Rack::Test in order to test the entire application, via a set
of HTTP calls. For example,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256/sixnines/blob/0.17/test/test_sixnines.rb#L143-L147&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
I&amp;#39;m trying to render Jeff&amp;#39;s user account page.
Its HTTP response code is supposed to be 200:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;unit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;AppTest&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Unit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;TestCase&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Rack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Sinatra&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Application&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;test_user_account&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;header&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Cookie&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sixnines&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;jeff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;assert_equal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;last_response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you can run the entire test from the command line. You can see how
&lt;a href=&quot;/2014/09/11/deployment-script-vs-rultor.html&quot;&gt;Rultor&lt;/a&gt;
runs it while releasing a new version: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rultor.com/t/11705-302080694&quot;&gt;full log&lt;/a&gt;.
Also, see how it works &lt;a href=&quot;https://travis-ci.org/yegor256/sixnines&quot;&gt;in Travis&lt;/a&gt;.
In a nutshell:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You call &lt;code&gt;rake&lt;/code&gt; in the command line and Rake starts;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rake attempts to run the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256/sixnines/blob/0.17/Rakefile#L32&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;default&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; task,
which depends on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256/sixnines/blob/0.17/Rakefile#L36&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;test&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rake attempts to run &lt;code&gt;test&lt;/code&gt;, which depends on
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256/sixnines/blob/0.17/Rakefile#L50&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;dynamo&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rake, inside &lt;code&gt;test&lt;/code&gt; task, runs &lt;code&gt;mvn install&lt;/code&gt; in the background
with this &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256/sixnines/blob/0.17/dynamodb-local/pom.xml&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;pom.xml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maven &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256/sixnines/blob/0.17/dynamodb-local/pom.xml#L38-L60&quot;&gt;unpacks&lt;/a&gt;
DynamoDB Local installation package;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maven &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256/sixnines/blob/0.17/dynamodb-local/pom.xml#L61-L78&quot;&gt;reserves&lt;/a&gt;
a random TCP port and stores its value into &lt;code&gt;${dynamo.port}&lt;/code&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maven &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256/sixnines/blob/0.17/dynamodb-local/pom.xml#L79-L100&quot;&gt;saves&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;code&gt;${dynamo.port}&lt;/code&gt; and key/secret pair info;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maven &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256/sixnines/blob/0.17/dynamodb-local/pom.xml#L101-L128&quot;&gt;starts&lt;/a&gt;
DynamoDB Local, binding it to the reserved TCP port;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rake &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256/sixnines/blob/0.17/Rakefile#L57-L65&quot;&gt;waits&lt;/a&gt;
for DynamoDB Local availability on the reserved port;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rake &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256/sixnines/blob/0.17/Rakefile#L38-L39&quot;&gt;imports&lt;/a&gt;
all &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256/sixnines/tree/0.17/test&quot;&gt;test classes&lt;/a&gt; starting from
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256/sixnines/blob/0.17/test/test__helper.rb&quot;&gt;test__helper.rb&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Environment variable &lt;code&gt;RACK_ENV&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256/sixnines/blob/0.17/test/test__helper.rb#L25&quot;&gt;set&lt;/a&gt;
to &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;test&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rack::Test &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256/sixnines/blob/0.17/test/test_sixnines.rb#L145&quot;&gt;attempts&lt;/a&gt;
to dispatch a web page;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256/sixnines/blob/0.17/objects/dynamo.rb&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Dynamo&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256/sixnines/blob/0.17/objects/dynamo.rb#L37-L39&quot;&gt;loads&lt;/a&gt; YAML config from
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256/sixnines/blob/0.17/dynamodb-local/config/dynamo.yml&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;dynamo.yml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
and connects to DynamoDB Local;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rake stops;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ruby &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256/sixnines/blob/0.17/Rakefile#L53-L56&quot;&gt;terminates&lt;/a&gt;
Maven and it stops DynamoDB Local.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be Positive&lt;/strong&gt;.
You must remember that keeping people happy
is more important than their results, effectiveness and productivity.
As an organic manager you must never offend your team with any
negativity, finger-pointing, or
&lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/05/how-to-be-honest-and-keep-customer.html&quot;&gt;honesty&lt;/a&gt;.
You must think positively and always find a balance somewhere between
&amp;quot;you guys are good&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;re just fantastic.&amp;quot;
You must be their full-hearted &lt;del&gt;clown&lt;/del&gt; cheerleader!
Truth hurts and modern management is not about hurting people, it&amp;#39;s about
making them happy. You must be a permanent source of good news, funny
stories, and smiles, shielding your &lt;del&gt;slaves&lt;/del&gt; people
from the reality and its threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;aside class=&#39;quote&#39;&gt;Truth hurts and modern management is not about hurting people, it&amp;#39;s about making them happy.&lt;/aside&gt;

You&amp;#39;re not sure? That&amp;#39;s wrong. You have to count. You don&amp;#39;t know how to
segregate bi-sexuals from &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; people and black females from white males?
Well, do the research, there must be some &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mischling_Test&quot;&gt;mischling tests&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; you could do.
You have to learn how to count and pay attention to the numbers.

for challenge, respect, curiosity, recognition, cooperation, and free beer

You must be very creative in hiding your actual

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be a Leader&lt;/strong&gt;.
Traditional &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html&quot;&gt;project management&lt;/a&gt;
with its critical path method,
contingency reserves, cause-and-effect diagrams,
work breakdown structures, policies, procedures, and plans, is dead.
&lt;a href=&quot;/2016/07/11/mistakes-in-agile-manifesto.html&quot;&gt;Agile&lt;/a&gt;,
Scrum, Kanban, and others, are dancing on its grave, with
motivational speeches, burndown rates, sprints,
&lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/08/morning-standup-meetings.html&quot;&gt;standups&lt;/a&gt;, and smoothies.
The world doesn&amp;#39;t need managers anymore, it needs leaders. And you must be one.
PMBOK and RUP on your bookshelf must be replaced with
Elon Musk and Peter Thiel biographies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be a Committer&lt;/strong&gt;.
Not a &lt;a href=&quot;https://git-scm.com/&quot;&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt;
committer, obviously&amp;mdash;that&amp;#39;s for junior programmers. You
have to commit yourself to the project, just like Tim Cook

to MacBooks. Technically, this means:
staying in the office till late,
taking no vacations,
wearing a branded t-shirt,
never discussing a salary or any money at all, and
being a proud patriot, no matter how ugly the product is.
In other words, being a
&lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html&quot;&gt;good slave&lt;/a&gt;
and showing your team a good example.
Don&amp;#39;t worry about the future, when projects fail good committers
just commit &lt;del&gt;suicide&lt;/del&gt; themselves to new projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be a Friend&lt;/strong&gt;.
Explicit and non-ambiguous work orders are not
popular any more&amp;mdash;they create tension and destroy
&lt;a href=&quot;/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html&quot;&gt;team morale&lt;/a&gt;.
Guilt-driven management is much more subtle and elegant:
you turn your subordinates into a family and then say:
&amp;quot;I count on you as a friend.&amp;quot;
Who can refuse a friend? And not even a friend, but a mom. This is
who they will associate you with when the guilt kicks in&amp;mdash;with their
mothers. They won&amp;#39;t disobey, won&amp;#39;t quit, and will never ask for
&lt;a href=&quot;/2016/12/06/how-to-pay-programmers-less.html&quot;&gt;more money&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;aside class=&#39;quote&#39;&gt;Don&amp;#39;t worry about the future, when projects fail good committers just commit themselves to new projects.&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be Responsible&lt;/strong&gt;.
In the brick-and-mortar management era responsibility was
&lt;a href=&quot;/2014/09/24/why-monetary-awards-dont-work.html&quot;&gt;measurable&lt;/a&gt;
by what you earn if you succeed and how you suffer if you fail.
Luckily, the world has recently learned that this
was a mistake we&amp;#39;d been making for
&lt;a href=&quot;/2016/09/27/command-control-innovate.html&quot;&gt;a hundreds years&lt;/a&gt;.
We don&amp;#39;t suffer any more.
Being responsible now means something completely different.
We wear stickers on our MacBooks,
we fall in love with &amp;quot;extremely talented people,&amp;quot;
we participate, engage, celebrate, and champion excellence.
And, of course, now it is
&lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/21/ringelmann-effect-vs-agile.html&quot;&gt;always&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;We&amp;quot; instead of &amp;quot;I&amp;quot;:
&amp;quot;We are responsible,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;It is our project,&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;We can,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Our goal is to do it together!&amp;quot;
Of course, when the project fails you find a new one, with a
&lt;a href=&quot;/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html&quot;&gt;bigger salary&lt;/a&gt;
and a new group of extremely talented people,
and become very responsible again. Nice, huh?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Yegor Bugayenko</name><email>yegor256@gmail.com</email></author><category term="management" /><category term="sarcasm" /><summary type="html">We live in the era of organic food, eco-friendly toilets, zero-emission cars,

&lt;a href=&quot;/2015/12/22/why-dont-you-contribute-to-open-source.html&quot;&gt;Why Don&amp;#39;t You Contribute to Open Source?&lt;/a&gt;.
I said there that if you don&amp;#39;t have your own OSS projects
or don&amp;#39;t give anything back to those you&amp;#39;re using&amp;mdash;something
is wrong with you. Now I&amp;#39;m talking to those who actually &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; contribute
without demanding anything back&amp;mdash;guys, you&amp;#39;re doing it wrong!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;figure class=&#39;jb_picture&#39;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&#39;image&#39; alt=&#39;The Untouchables (1987) by Brian De Palma&#39; src=&#39;/images/2017/05/the-untouchables.jpg&#39; longdesc=&#39;#93469771&#39;/&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&#39;93469771&#39;&gt;The Untouchables (1987) by Brian De Palma&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open source &lt;del&gt;almost&lt;/del&gt; always means &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt;, as in beer&amp;mdash;nobody will
pay you anything for your pull requests. However, it doesn&amp;#39;t mean
you&amp;#39;re not allowed to make money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, you will not earn any cash directly by fixing a bug in
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/docker/docker&quot;&gt;docker/docker&lt;/a&gt;, but you &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; earn
some intangible value, which will be converted to cash later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, you &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; earn it&amp;mdash;this is my point. Otherwise, if you contribute
out of pure
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altruism&quot;&gt;altruism&lt;/a&gt;,
you will lose the motivation very soon. Not because
you&amp;#39;re greedy and
&lt;a href=&quot;/2014/09/24/why-monetary-awards-dont-work.html&quot;&gt;only money&lt;/a&gt;
can motivate you, but because without
money you won&amp;#39;t feel your efforts are being truly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intangible value I&amp;#39;m talking about is, of course, your
&lt;a href=&quot;/2016/03/08/pimp-up-your-resume.html&quot;&gt;resume&lt;/a&gt;. If you
are an active contributor to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/docker/docker&quot;&gt;docker/docker&lt;/a&gt;,
your resume says so, and you&amp;#39;re in the list of contributors&amp;mdash;your
hourly rate or your salary will
&lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html&quot;&gt;definitely&lt;/a&gt; be higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;aside class=&#39;quote&#39;&gt;If you contribute out of pure altruism, you will lose the motivation very soon.&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would recommend, before becoming a contributor, you ask yourself a question: How will
this affect my resume, my profile, and my reputation on the market? Will they
put me into the list of contributors? Will they promote me in exchange
for my pull requests? Will I be able to mention their name in my
next job interview?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most projects won&amp;#39;t do anything for you unless you &lt;em&gt;explicitly&lt;/em&gt; ask.
I&amp;#39;m a maintainer of over 40 GitHub repositories and at least six of them
have over 200 stars
(&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256/tacit&quot;&gt;yegor256/tacit&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256/takes&quot;&gt;yegor256/takes&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256/rultor&quot;&gt;yegor256/rultor&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yegor256/eo&quot;&gt;yegor256/eo&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jcabi/jcabi-aspects&quot;&gt;jcabi/jcabi-aspects&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/teamed/qulice&quot;&gt;teamed/qulice&lt;/a&gt;).
If you submit a pull request to any of them, I will
just review it, merge and forget your name.
I won&amp;#39;t do anything else, simply because &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; didn&amp;#39;t ask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if you ask me to put your name and a link to your blog
in the list of contributors, I will do it without any hesitation.
Moreover, if you do that right inside the pull request you are submitting,
I will merge it and your name will go right into the repo, into the very
place you find the most suitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last six years of my active participation in open source
development I&amp;#39;ve never seen anyone asking me that. Why? I don&amp;#39;t know.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Yegor Bugayenko</name><email>yegor256@gmail.com</email></author><category term="programming" /><summary type="html">You probably remember my half-a-year-old article:

or stable a piece of software is, it has an &lt;em&gt;unlimited&lt;/em&gt; number
of bugs not yet found. No matter how many of them we have already managed
to find and fix, there are still too many left to count.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;figure class=&#39;jb_picture&#39;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&#39;image&#39; alt=&#39;L&amp;#39;amico di famiglia (2006) by Paolo Sorrentino&#39; src=&#39;/images/2017/05/lamico-di-famiglia.jpg&#39; longdesc=&#39;#5232e494&#39;/&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&#39;5232e494&#39;&gt;L&amp;#39;amico di famiglia (2006) by Paolo Sorrentino&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s take this simple Java method that calculates a sum of two integers
as an example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This simple program has an &lt;em&gt;unlimited&lt;/em&gt; number of bugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To prove this claim we just need to put two thoughts together:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, a bug is something that compromises the quality of software,
which, according to
&lt;a href=&quot;https://standards.ieee.org/findstds/standard/610.12-1990.html&quot;&gt;IEEE&amp;nbsp;610.12-1990&lt;/a&gt;,
is &amp;quot;the degree to which
a system meets specified requirements or &lt;em&gt;user expectations&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, requirements and expectations may be functional and non-functional.
The latter include performance, resilience, robustness, &lt;em&gt;maintainability&lt;/em&gt;,
and a few dozen other
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-functional_requirement&quot;&gt;NFRs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is obvious that there are at least two variables in this equation that
are ambiguous: user expectations and
&lt;a href=&quot;/2015/06/11/wikipedia-bug-definition.html&quot;&gt;maintainability&lt;/a&gt;.
We can&amp;#39;t be precise about them and that&amp;#39;s why the number of bugs
they will produce has no limit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, only a very limited subset of the entire set of bugs has any
real business impact. Most of the bugs that exist in a program may
stay there even after it is shipped to its users&amp;mdash;nobody will ever
find them or else the damage they cause to the user experience will be
insignificant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, take a look at the method &lt;code&gt;sum()&lt;/code&gt; one more time. How about these bugs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t handle overflows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t have any user documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Its design is not object-oriented&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t sum three or more numbers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t sum &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt; numbers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t cast &lt;code&gt;long&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; automatically&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t skip execution if one argument is zero&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t cache results of previous calculations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no logging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checkstyle would complain since arguments are not &lt;code&gt;final&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure you can find many more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BTW, Glenford J. Myers said something very similar in his book
&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1Y3qAbN&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;The Art of Software Testing,&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; which I
