  the consequences

Finding a good co-founder is a difficult task. Motivating him or her
to join your startup is even a more difficult one. But there is another
question I want to discuss&mdash;do you really **need** one? Do you really
need a co-founder or maybe you can just hire someone to work for you?
There is a big difference between these two things&mdash;a **co-founder**
and a **worker**.

Imagine, you want to build a house and you have enough cash for it. You
hire a construction company, they build that house for you, you pay them
and they walk away. You're the sole owner of the house and these guys
own nothing. They just made some money and did some work for you.

However, you can help them build that house. If you don't have enough cash
to pay for everything you may do some work yourself. That will save you
some money and will keep you busy for a few months.

There is exactly the same story with a startup. You're the owner of it,
while people you hire are helping you to build it and you pay them.

So, who is the co-founder? It's a person, who owns that house together with you.
You give a portion of your ownership in exchange to... what? In the most
transparent case it is money. The co-founder gives you cash and walks away.
You keep building the house/startup and when it's ready, the co-founder
shows up and you split the profit. Because, let's say, 25% of that cash
you spent on building the house was provided by the co-founder.

Everything is clear, cash is cash. But that's rarely the case. In most startups
founders and co-founders have no cash. All they have is their time, which
they are ready spend on building that house/startup. And that's where
the situation becomes more complicated and leads to ugly conflicts.
