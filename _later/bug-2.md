Bug is something that causes our software products to crash and us to cry.
This is a traditional attitude to a "software bug". From a user perspective
it is a perfectly accurate description of a role of bugs&mdash;they make
user's life miserable. Software users want to see as less bugs as possible
in order to give our product their kudos (and buy the next version).

However, me and my software development company,&mdash;we're on the other side
of the barricade. We're the ones who create bugs. That's why our attitude
to bugs is completely opposite&mdash;we love them. They give us confidence.
Why? Because the more bugs we create, find, and remove&mdash;the less we ship to our users.
Despite this clear and obvious logic, I see that for most programmers,
software shops and our clients it is difficult to understand such an attitude.
That's why this article&mdash;it explains how we manage a bug since the
moment it is reported till the moment we close it and archive.
