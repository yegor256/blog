I had a dinner with a friend of mine yesterday and he shared with me that he was
going to build a new mobile app for his new brilliant idea. He said that
he has already found a very trustful software company that has already
promised him to develop the app for as little as $150,000. He was asking
for my advice: "Is it a fair price?" What could I say? I said, listen, dude,
you can't simply trust someone $150K to build an app you need. You have
to know how it is being built, to work with them shoulder-to-shoulder,
and to pay incrementally.
He replied: "But I'm a restaurant owner, I have no idea how you nerds work!"

It would be funny if it weren't so sad. The situation is very typical: there
is money, there is an idea, and there is a team of programmers ready to
take that cash and implement the idea. In the end: there is no money,
there is some piece of software that works somehow, there are no users,
no success, and a lot of frustration.

I've seen it multiple times. From both sides of the fence.

Want to know what did I tell my friend? I promised him to write a blog post
to explain what he should do instead of wiring that $150K to his
genius programmers. Here is the blog post.

The problem is that money people are trying to oversimplify the process
of software development and make it "transactional," similar to what they are
used to: buying a car or hiring a plumber. They want to pay the price
and get the result. With us, programmers, it doesn't work like that.
Because we are smarter than car dealers and plumbers, our
craft is way more complicated, and our results are absolutely unpredictable.

In other words, you will pay for a car but we will deliver you a chair
strictly according to the contract. Disappointed? We are very sorry.
Next, please!

If you really want a ~~car~~ software that will do what you expect
it to do, you have to learn how to be a _Product Owner_. It's a new job you will
have to occupy for the next few months or maybe years. You will occupy it
anyway, either you like it or not. But if you do that consciously and well
aware of how it all works, you can lose a little less money and increase
your chances to success.

Again, if you don't learn, you will lose and we, programmers, will win.

So, you better learn.

Below are the terms and concepts I would recommend anyone, who is going to become
a product owner and a project sponsor, to understand. I put
them here in no particular order, they are all equally important. Each concept
has a list of questions you should ask your programmers and they have to
give you the answers you can understand. Don't skip a single concept or
a question here, they all are equally and very important.

**Bug**
is a defect (something doesn't look right) programmers are supposed to fix.
Any software has [a lot of]({% pst 2017/may/2017-05-23-unlimited-number-of-bugs %})
bugs and this is how it should be. It's important to find bugs as early as possible
and fix them as soon as possible.

[Five Principles of Bug Tracking]({% pst 2014/nov/2014-11-24-principles-of-bug-tracking %})

**Deployment Pipeline**.
Read:
[Continuous Delivery](https://amzn.to/2c7sR4V) (book).

**Continuous Integration**.

**Release**
is the next version of the software we show to our users.


**Unit Test**
is a supplementary software modules programmers create in order to make
their life easier. Unit tests automatically verify the software. They
do it much faster and better that any tester can do. Smart programmers
know how to create unit tests. Most likely your programmers are not smart
and you have to control how much unit tests they create and how effective
they are.
[Fools Don't Write Unit Tests]({% pst 2015/jul/2015-07-16-fools-dont-write-unit-tests %})

**Static Analysis**
is

**Framework**

**Staff-Hour**

**NDA**

**Build**

**Role**
is what the project team consists off. Most popular roles are:
architect, team lead, developer, product owner (it's you), project
manager, tester, DevOps, release manager.

**DevOps**
is a how we call people responsible for organizing the deployment pipeline
and making sure the production works as expected.

**Production**
is a place where our software meets its users. If it's a web site,
this place is also known as "web hosting," if it's a mobile app this
place would be Apple Store, for example. The main goal of the software
team is to put the next release to

**Staging**

**Sprint**

**Ticket**

**Git**

**Backlog**

That's it. You will be a tech-savvy product owner if you have all these
questions answered and you understand the answers. You will waste your
$150,000 much more wisely.
