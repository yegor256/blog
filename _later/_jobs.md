It's not a secret that our salaries are a
[secret](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidburkus/2016/02/02/why-do-we-keep-salaries-secret/).
Employers don't like their employees to know and discuss each other wages.
Moreover, ~~most~~ some of them even put restrictive
[pay gag clauses](https://www.recruiter.com/i/gag-clause/) into
employment contracts or NDA-s. Despite [recent efforts](https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/84)
of law makers to make that clauses illegal,
about half of American employees are still explicitly prohibited
or strongly [discouraged](https://www.iwpr.org/publications/pubs/pay-secrecy-and-wage-discrimination)
from discussing pay with their coworkers.
My question is do we really want to know how much our friends are making and
will that information, if being available, help us write better software?

I decided to ask on Twitter in order to understand the real situation
in the industry (the majority of my
Twitter followers are programmers, according to
this [recent survey](https://twitter.com/yegor256/status/975251031448784896)):

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Do you know how much your co-workers are making? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/paysecrecy?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#paysecrecy</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/payequality?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#payequality</a></p>&mdash; Yegor Bugayenko (@yegor256) <a href="https://twitter.com/yegor256/status/1041243885710786560?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 16, 2018</a></blockquote>

As you see, the majority of respondents are indeed kept in the dark about the money
others make in the same project or in the same office.

Why this is happening? Why employers want to keep wages secret,
despite the [arguments](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/088636878201400305)
that it negatively affects performance and motivation?
It seems that there are a number of obvious reasons:

  * **Weakness**.
    According to [Edward E. Lawler III](https://www.forbes.com/sites/edwardlawler/2012/09/12/pay-secrecy-why-bother/#5fd90f646a60),
    "Secrecy helps them cover up their bad decision making; and with secrecy,
    they do not have to correct the problems or defend what they have done."
    In other words, they (or their management systems) are too _weak_ to answer
    some unpleasant money questions, that's why it's easier to make them _illegal_.

  * **Control**.
    According to a very interesting summary
    [_Pay Secrecy: Pros and Cons_](https://scindeks-clanci.ceon.rs/data/pdf/0353-443X/2016/0353-443X1604225J.pdf)
    by Nebojša Janićijević,
    "the less information the employees have, the more
    easily they are controlled by the management," because "withholding
    information and disclosing only the selected details is one
    of the main forms of manipulation through which the
    management can guide the employees to act the way the
    management wants."

  * **Conflicts**.

  * **Lawsuits**.

On the other hand, it seems that keeping salaries secret gives advantages
to employees too, including:

  * ****.

Looking at these lists, isn't it obvious that
it's a much safer, for both employees and their bosses,
to keep the information about wages secret? Some companies,
including Uber, Facebook, Google and others, are going even further
and officially making the life of their

- people are afraid to know how much they make
- companies have to protect themselves against law suits

about half of American employees in all sectors are either explicitly prohibited or strongly discouraged from discussing pay with their coworkers.

- the solution is to pay equally

- the alternative
  - results-attached KPIs
  - explicit rules of the game
  - transparent processes
  - visibility of formulas



secrecy hurts because:
 - bosses hide something
 -

I believe that all that can be labeled as "weak management," which
means lack of professional knowledge and education, cowardness, laziness,
neglect, and good old plain stupidity.

A strong manager knows 1) how to define clear and explicit rules of work,
and 2) how to enforce them through a system of awards and punishments.

Even if pay secrecy comes with good intentions, this is its unintended effect: It tells workers that their bosses have something to hide

We created a formula for how salaries are calculated and added it to our Wiki page for everyone on the team to see

secrecy helps them cover up their bad decision making; and with secrecy, they do not have to correct the problems or defend what they have done.
with secrecy, managers can make poor pay decisions because they do not have to defend them
a clear relationship between pay and performance that may be very motivating becomes blurred and unclear because of secrecy

http://theconversation.com/if-you-want-high-performers-kill-pay-secrecy-49207
Organisations believe that employees cannot handle the truth about their value to the organisation relative to other employees
Employees are, however, still interested in pay even when there is no information provided by the organisation.
The absence of pay information creates the impression among employees that management has something to hide
Pay secrecy covers up the relationship between pay and performance:
High performing employees are particularly sensitive than others when they perceive no link between performance and pay
Hiding all the work behind a wall of secrecy reduces the effectiveness of the system and increases the risk of ad hoc decision making, which in turn can lead to legal challenges and reputational damage.
