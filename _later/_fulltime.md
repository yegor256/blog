I'm frequently being asked by programmers who are planning to join
[Zerocracy]({% pst 2018/mar/2018-03-21-zerocracy-announcement %})
or have joined already and now trying to figure out how much money they can make in the platform:
Is it possible to work here full-time? Here is my answer: Why do you want
to work full-time in the first place? I would suggest
you to ask a different question instead: Is it possible to make
$200 an hour here? Unfortunately, I hear that question much less frequently.

We used to think that our income depends on the amount of time we spend
for a project. If we sit there for 8-10 hours a day, we get a full
monthly salary, which will most likely cover all our expenses. This
is what the industry calls _full-time_ engagement and it's pretty safe:
as long as the project is alive, our expenses will be covered.

If we work in a few projects, spending a few hours a day here and there,
we have to put their payckecks together making sure they cover our
expenses. This is called _part-time_ and it's risky, since we have
to always be on alert---whether there are enough projects in the pipeline,
whether they pay enough, and where do we find new ones when these projects
~~fire us~~ finishe.

Full-time employment is way more secure. However, it has a number of drawbacks.

**You are not being challenged**.

**You can't make $25,000 a month**.
No matter how talented you are, assuming you are a programmer, you can't make
that much (

Thus, I would suggest switching from the security-driven mindset to the
results-driven one.
