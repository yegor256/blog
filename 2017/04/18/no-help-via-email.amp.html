They ask questions about Java, management, object-oriented programming, and other things they believe I understand and can help them with. Well, my contact details are published right in the header on my blog—what else would I expect, right? True, but even though I always reply to them, I never answer their questions.</p><amp-img src="/images/2017/04/il-divo.jpg"alt="Il Divo (2008) by Paolo Sorrentino"height="545"width="1280"layout="responsive"></amp-img><p>Why?<p>Because it’s ineffective.<p>Honestly, I believe that the more people I help, the better. The bigger my contribution to the community is, the better—for both the community and me personally. That’s why I try to answer every single comment on this blog, on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/yegor256?sub_confirmation=1">YouTube channel</a>, in our <a href="https://gitter.im/yegor256/elegantobjects">Gitter chat</a>, and on <a href="https://twitter.com/yegor256">Twitter</a>. I spend at least two hours a day on this activity.<p>That’s why I’m asking everybody who seeks help from me personally to go to one of these public channels and ask there. Then, I will find their questions and answer them. Maybe even someone else will reply, because the community is pretty big now.<p>When the question is asked publicly, <em>everybody</em> can see our conversation and learn something from it. This is the most effective use of my time and the time of those who are asking.<p>Thus, you can expect <strong>no help</strong> provided privately, but all public questions will be answered.</article>
