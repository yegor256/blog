      <h1>Flexibility Equates to Lower Quality</h1>
      <p>There are two opposing mindsets: “If it works, it’s good” vs.
“If it’s good, it works;” or “Make it work” vs. “Make it right.”
I’m talking about the software source code. I’ve been hearing this
almost every day in blog comments: Why do we need all those <em>new</em> OOP
principles if our code works just fine without them? What is the
point of introducing a new way, which is supposed to be “better,”
if the existing, traditional, semi-object, semi-procedural, not-so-perfect
approach <em>just works</em>?</p>



<amp-img src="/images/2017/04/scarface.jpg" alt="Scarface (1983) by Brian De Palma" height="545" width="1280" layout="responsive"></amp-img>

<p>Let’s try to think bigger. And not just about object-oriented programming, but
in general about software development. There are many examples of the
“just works” mentality.</p>

<p>Take Perl, a programming language famous
for its ability to do anything in three different ways. This means that
there is no one “right” way. I’m not a Perl expert; that’s why I’ll have you
look at this Ruby code instead:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">b</span>
  <span class="n">m</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'Hello!'</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can rewrite it like this:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">m</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">b</span>
  <span class="s1">'Hello!'</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Or this:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">m</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'Hello!'</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">b</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And one more:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">m</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="p">?</span> <span class="s1">'Hello'</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="kp">nil</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Which one is “right?” Are there any Perl developers? Can you suggest
some other way to achieve the same result?</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, in Java (a stricter language than Ruby),
there is only one way to do it:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">m</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"Hello!"</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Well, I guess I’m wrong; there are two, actually. Here is the second one:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">m</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"Hello!"</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What does this variety of options give us, as programmers? I guess the answer
seriously depends on what we, the programmers, are doing with the code:
writing or reading it. Also, it depends on our
<a href="/2014/10/26/hacker-vs-programmer-mentality.html">attitude</a> toward the
software we’re creating; we either
<em>own</em> it (hacker mentality) or
<em>build</em> it (designer mentality).</p>

<p>If we’re <em>writing</em> it, and we love to think about ourselves as code owners, we
definitely will need that arsenal of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar">syntactic sugar</a> weapons. We need them to prove to ourselves
that we’re smart and, of course, to show off in front of our friends and
that soulless Ruby interpreter.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if we’re designers and happen to <em>read</em> the code that is
full of sugar, which “just works,” we’ll be very annoyed and
frustrated. Well, maybe I have to speak for myself, but I definitely will be.</p>



<p>This overly-sugared Ruby syntax is a perfect example of “works vs. good”
positioning. Ruby philosophy is this: It doesn’t matter how you write it, as long
as it works. Java philosophy is different; it’s much closer to:
Make it right and it will work.
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_and_weak_typing">weak</a>
and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#Dynamic_type_checking_and_runtime_type_information">dynamic</a>
typing in Ruby vs. the strong and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#Static_type_checking">static</a>
one in Java also prove my point.</p>

<p>In general, I believe that the more flexible the programming language is, the
lower the <em>maintainability</em>—the key quality characteristic—of the code it produces.
Simply put, higher quality comes from simpler languages.</p>

<p>The same is true for the entire software development: The more restrictions
we put on programmers and the fewer options they have for their
“syntax creativity,” the higher the quality of the software they write.
Static analyzers like
<a href="http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/">Checkstyle</a> for Java or
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop">Rubocop</a> for Ruby attempt
to solve that problem and prohibit us from using certain language features,
but they lag far behind. We are very “creative.”</p>

<p>Now, let’s get back to the original OOP question:
Why do we need to improve anything if it works the way it is?
Here is the answer: Modern OOP (as in Java, Ruby, and C++)
doesn’t produce quality code because it doesn’t have a strong
and properly restricted paradigm. It just has too many “features,”
which were mostly introduced by C++ and remained there for our
mutual “convenience.”</p>

<p>They indeed work, but the maintainability of the software we produce
is very low. Well, it’s way lower than it could be, if our “creativity”
would be restricted.</p>
