I’ve been hearing this almost every day in blog comments: Why do we need all those <em>new</em> OOP principles if our code works just fine without them? What is the point of introducing a new way, which is supposed to be “better,” if the existing, traditional, semi-object, semi-procedural, not-so-perfect approach <em>just works</em>?</p><amp-img src="/images/2017/04/scarface.jpg"alt="Scarface (1983) by Brian De Palma"height="545"width="1280"layout="responsive"></amp-img><p>Let’s try to think bigger. And not just about object-oriented programming, but in general about software development. There are many examples of the “just works” mentality.<p>Take Perl, a programming language famous for its ability to do anything in three different ways. This means that there is no one “right” way. I’m not a Perl expert; that’s why I’ll have you look at this Ruby code instead:<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">b</span>
  <span class="n">m</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'Hello!'</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>We can rewrite it like this:<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">m</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">b</span>
  <span class="s1">'Hello!'</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>Or this:<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">m</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'Hello!'</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">b</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>And one more:<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">m</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="p">?</span> <span class="s1">'Hello'</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="kp">nil</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>Which one is “right?” Are there any Perl developers? Can you suggest some other way to achieve the same result?<p>Not surprisingly, in Java (a stricter language than Ruby), there is only one way to do it:<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">m</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"Hello!"</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>Well, I guess I’m wrong; there are two, actually. Here is the second one:<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">m</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"Hello!"</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>What does this variety of options give us, as programmers? I guess the answer seriously depends on what we, the programmers, are doing with the code: writing or reading it. Also, it depends on our <a href="/2014/10/26/hacker-vs-programmer-mentality.html">attitude</a> toward the software we’re creating; we either <em>own</em> it (hacker mentality) or <em>build</em> it (designer mentality).<p>If we’re <em>writing</em> it, and we love to think about ourselves as code owners, we definitely will need that arsenal of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar">syntactic sugar</a> weapons. We need them to prove to ourselves that we’re smart and, of course, to show off in front of our friends and that soulless Ruby interpreter.<p>On the other hand, if we’re designers and happen to <em>read</em> the code that is full of sugar, which “just works,” we’ll be very annoyed and frustrated. Well, maybe I have to speak for myself, but I definitely will be.<p>This overly-sugared Ruby syntax is a perfect example of “works vs. good” positioning. Ruby philosophy is this: It doesn’t matter how you write it, as long as it works. Java philosophy is different; it’s much closer to: Make it right and it will work. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_and_weak_typing">weak</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#Dynamic_type_checking_and_runtime_type_information">dynamic</a> typing in Ruby vs. the strong and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#Static_type_checking">static</a> one in Java also prove my point.<p>In general, I believe that the more flexible the programming language is, the lower the <em>maintainability</em>—the key quality characteristic—of the code it produces. Simply put, higher quality comes from simpler languages.<p>The same is true for the entire software development: The more restrictions we put on programmers and the fewer options they have for their “syntax creativity,” the higher the quality of the software they write. Static analyzers like <a href="http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/">Checkstyle</a> for Java or <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop">Rubocop</a> for Ruby attempt to solve that problem and prohibit us from using certain language features, but they lag far behind. We are very “creative.”<p>Now, let’s get back to the original OOP question: Why do we need to improve anything if it works the way it is? Here is the answer: Modern OOP (as in Java, Ruby, and C++) doesn’t produce quality code because it doesn’t have a strong and properly restricted paradigm. It just has too many “features,” which were mostly introduced by C++ and remained there for our mutual “convenience.”<p>They indeed work, but the maintainability of the software we produce is very low. Well, it’s way lower than it could be, if our “creativity” would be restricted.<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"data-lang="en"><p lang="en"dir="ltr">An ability to implement the same thing in a few different ways (a.k.a.
