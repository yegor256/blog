      <h1>Gluten-Free Management Recipes</h1>
      <p>We live in the era of organic food, eco-friendly toilets, zero-emission cars,
and
<a href="/2017/07/18/sexual-harassment.html">harassment-free</a>
offices. Our management practices have to keep up—they
must be zero-stress, conflict-free, and idiot-friendly. If you’re still
stuck in the old carrot-and-stick, mediocrity-intolerant, primitive mentality,
these recipes will open your eyes.</p>



<amp-img src="/images/2017/06/dogville.jpg" alt="Dogville (2003) by Lars von Trier" height="769" width="1280" layout="responsive"></amp-img>

<p><strong>Be Positive</strong>.
You must remember that keeping people happy
is more important than their results, effectiveness and productivity.
As an organic manager you must never offend your team with any
negativity, finger-pointing, or
<a href="/2015/01/05/how-to-be-honest-and-keep-customer.html">honesty</a>.
You must think positively and always find a balance somewhere between
“you guys are good” and “you’re just fantastic.”
You must be their full-hearted <del>clown</del> cheerleader!
Truth hurts and modern management is not about hurting people, it’s about
making them happy. You must be a permanent source of good news, funny
stories, and smiles, shielding your <del>slaves</del> people
from the reality and its threats.</p>



<p><strong>Be Politically Correct</strong>.
How many <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-people-are-using-the-term-latinx_us_57753328e4b0cc0fa136a159">latinx</a>
are in your team? What about gays and transsexuals?
You’re not sure? That’s wrong. You have to count. You don’t know how to
segregate bi-sexuals from “normal” people and black females from white males?
Well, do the research, there must be some “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mischling_Test">mischling tests</a>” you could do.
You have to learn how to count and pay attention to the numbers.
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/28/uber-first-diversity-report/">Uber</a>
and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/01/krablr-releases-first-diversity-report/">others</a>
already do. Diversity, equality, and tolerance: these metrics are
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKcWu0tsiZM">quickly replacing</a>
outdated performance and productivity
<a href="/2020/06/23/individual-performance-metrics.html">appraisals</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Don’t Be Reward-Focused</strong>.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Trotsky">Trotsky</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Revolution_Betrayed">said</a> in 1937
that people would eventually work not out of greed or poverty, but because
they just enjoy it. He would be happy to see
that his prophesy finally
<a href="https://techbeacon.com/13-ways-motivate-software-engineers">came true</a>:
programmers don’t work for money any more.
They <a href="https://www.verywell.com/what-is-intrinsic-motivation-2795385">work</a>
for challenge, respect, curiosity, recognition, cooperation, and free beer
on Fridays. As a modern eco-manager you must stop humiliating them
with old-fashioned
<a href="/2014/09/24/why-monetary-awards-dont-work.html">dollar bills</a>
and start inspiring them with these
<a href="/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html">intrinsic rewards</a>
and free cookies.
You will <a href="/2016/12/06/how-to-pay-programmers-less.html">save some money</a> too.</p>

<p><strong>Be Equal</strong>.
<a href="/2016/02/18/holacracy-autocracy.html">Holacracy</a>
is quickly replacing military-style management hierarchies, which
proved to be depressing and hurtful to human feelings. Modern managers
don’t even like to be called “managers.” Instead, they
<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshlinkner/2014/12/04/the-21-most-creative-job-titles/#2b863a112933">demand</a>
we call them ambassadors, curators, cheerleaders, and catalysts.
You must be very creative in hiding your actual
career ladder position, in order not to irritate and hurt your team.
Of course, you will still use fear and guilt to keep your
<a href="/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html">slaves</a> under control,
but new eco-titles will help you keep them less aware of what’s going on.</p>



<p><strong>Be a Leader</strong>.
Traditional <a href="/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html">project management</a>
with its critical path method,
contingency reserves, cause-and-effect diagrams,
work breakdown structures, policies, procedures, and plans, is dead.
<a href="/2016/07/11/mistakes-in-agile-manifesto.html">Agile</a>,
Scrum, Kanban, and others, are dancing on its grave, with
motivational speeches, burndown rates, sprints,
<a href="/2015/01/08/morning-standup-meetings.html">standups</a>, and smoothies.
The world doesn’t need managers anymore, it needs leaders. And you must be one.
PMBOK and RUP on your bookshelf must be replaced with
Elon Musk and Peter Thiel biographies.</p>

<p><strong>Be a Committer</strong>.
Not a <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>
committer, obviously—that’s for junior programmers. You
have to commit yourself to the project, just like Tim Cook
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/19/apples-tim-cook-assures-employees-that-it-is-committed-to-the-mac-and-that-great-desktops-are-coming/">committed</a>
to MacBooks. Technically, this means:
staying in the office till late,
taking no vacations,
wearing a branded t-shirt,
never discussing a salary or any money at all, and
being a proud patriot, no matter how ugly the product is.
In other words, being a
<a href="/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html">good slave</a>
and showing your team a good example.
Don’t worry about the future, when projects fail good committers
just commit <del>suicide</del> themselves to new projects.</p>

<p><strong>Be a Friend</strong>.
Explicit and non-ambiguous work orders are not
popular any more—they create tension and destroy
<a href="/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html">team morale</a>.
Guilt-driven management is much more subtle and elegant:
you turn your subordinates into a family and then say:
“I count on you as a friend.”
Who can refuse a friend? And not even a friend, but a mom. This is
who they will associate you with when the guilt kicks in—with their
mothers. They won’t disobey, won’t quit, and will never ask for
<a href="/2016/12/06/how-to-pay-programmers-less.html">more money</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Be Responsible</strong>.
In the brick-and-mortar management era responsibility was
<a href="/2014/09/24/why-monetary-awards-dont-work.html">measurable</a>
by what you earn if you succeed and how you suffer if you fail.
Luckily, the world has recently learned that this
was a mistake we’d been making for
<a href="/2016/09/27/command-control-innovate.html">a hundreds years</a>.
We don’t suffer any more.
Being responsible now means something completely different.
We wear stickers on our MacBooks,
we fall in love with “extremely talented people,”
we participate, engage, celebrate, and champion excellence.
And, of course, now it is
<a href="/2015/11/21/ringelmann-effect-vs-agile.html">always</a> “We” instead of “I”:
“We are responsible,” “It is our project,”
“We can,” “Our goal is to do it together!”
Of course, when the project fails you find a new one, with a
<a href="/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html">bigger salary</a>
and a new group of extremely talented people,
and become very responsible again. Nice, huh?</p>

<p><strong>Be Democratic</strong> (added on 19-Oct-2020).
If in doubt, always call a
<a href="/2015/07/13/meetings-are-legalized-robbery.html">meeting</a>
and ask <em>everybody</em> to
<a href="/2019/01/15/what-if-architect-is-wrong.html">vote</a>.
This is the only right way today to make technical decisions without
offending anyone. Our civilization is built on
<a href="/2016/02/18/holacracy-autocracy.html">democratic principles</a>,
why software projects can’t utilize the same idea, right?</p>
