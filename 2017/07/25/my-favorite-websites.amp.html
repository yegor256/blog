Now I’ll list my most favorite websites and online services, which help me do my daily job: write code and manage projects.<p><br><a href="https://www.gmail.com">Gmail</a> is the best email system. It aggregates all my accounts in one place: all emails are coming to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@gmail.com</code> address and I have a few aliases for sending responses. <a href="https://calendar.google.com">Google Calendar</a> helps me keep my plans in sync, and <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive">Google Drive</a> helps me share documents with friends sometimes.<p><br><a href="https://github.com/yegor256">GitHub</a> is where we keep our source code repositories. I was also using <a href="https://bitbucket.com">Bitbucket</a> a few years ago, but didn’t really like it. GitHub is simply the best, no doubts.<p><br><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/187141/yegor256">Stack Overflow</a> is where I learn new technologies, ask questions, answer them sometimes and really enjoy working with the community. When I have some free time I just search by “<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/design-patterns">design-patterns</a>” or “<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/oop">oop</a>” tags in order to find relevant questions and answer them if I can.<p><br><a href="https://www.wring.io">Wring</a> aggregates my GitHub notifications and helps me stay on top of all events that are happening there. It’s my own project and I use it every day.<p><br><a href="https://www.rultor.com">Rultor</a> is helping me <a href="/2014/07/24/rultor-automated-merging.html">merge</a> pull requests, <a href="/2014/09/11/deployment-script-vs-rultor.html">deploy</a> my projects to production and <a href="/2014/08/19/how-to-release-to-maven-central.html">release</a> their new versions. It’s one of my <a href="/pets.html">pet projects</a> and I’m using it every day.<p><br><a href="https://www.heroku.com">Heroku</a> is where I host almost all my Java and Ruby projects.<p><br><a href="https://travis-ci.org">Travis</a> for open source and <a href="https://shippable.com">Shippable</a> for commercial projects, as continuous integration platforms. There are <a href="/2014/10/05/ten-hosted-continuous-integration-services.html">many alternatives</a>, but I like these guys.<p><br><a href="https://www.godaddy.com">Godaddy</a> is where I register all domain names. Their user interface is terrible, but their prices are the lowest. So, I’m with them for at least eight years already.<p><br><a href="http://analytics.google.com">Google Analytics</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home">Google Webmasters</a> are two systems where I track my entire web traffic of all my websites. Both systems are terrible, performance and interface wise. But since it’s Google, we have to stay with them, to see how they understand web statistics. I’m also using <a href="https://hit.ua">hit.ua</a>.<p><br><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/">/r/programming</a> at Reddit seem to be the best sources of news for me. I open them a few times a week.<p><br><a href="https://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a> are the social networks I’m spamming regularly. They are far from being perfect, but they totally dominate the market. I was using these guys, but they seem to be <del>dead</del> less popular now: LinkedIn, Google+.<p><br><a href="https://amzn.to/2ufwBbw">Amazon</a> is where I buy everything that is not food or clothes.<p><br><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a> is where I keep all <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">my data</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/route53/">my DNS</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">my servers</a>, and some other things. I’m with them since they launched S3 (in 2006).<p><br><a href="https://contabo.com/">Contabo</a> is where I host servers, which I need 24x7. Their prices are great and the service is pretty decent. I’m with them for at least five years.<p><br><a href="https://papertrailapp.com/?thank=9e5dc6">Papertrail</a> is where all my logs are being aggregated. I tried a few other systems, but these guys seem to be the best. I even was paying them something some time ago, but stopped—their free package seems to be sufficient enough for my volumes.<p><br><a href="https://www.statuscake.com/">StatusCake</a> is a website monitoring system that keeps an eye on all my web sites and web apps and notifies me by email and through <a href="https://pushover.net/">Pushover</a> ($5).<p><br><a href="https://www.sentry.io">Sentry</a> is where all my errors are being sent to, from production systems.<p><br><a href="https://www.buffer.com">Buffer</a> is helping me to spam Twitter and Facebook more effectively. I pay them for the premium package and have no regrets. The service really helps me deliver content to the social networks on schedule.<p><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a> is where I keep my video content. I also stream <a href="/webinars.html">my webinars</a> there.<p><br><a href="https://www.soundcloud.com">SoundCloud</a> is where I’m listening to music and keep my own channel with <a href="/shift-m.html">Shift-M</a> podcast and other audio content.<p><br><a href="https://qdc.qbo.intuit.com/qbo30/login">QuickBooks</a> is where I keep all my bookkeeping accounts, for all my companies.<p>Did I forget anything?</article>
